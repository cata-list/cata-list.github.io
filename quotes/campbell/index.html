an American mythologist, writer, and lecturer, best known for his work in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's magnum opus is his book 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces' (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero found in world mythologies.</p> <div class="wiki-container"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joseph_Campbell" target="_blank" class="wiki">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell" target="_blank" class="wiki">Wikiquote</a> <!----></div> <div class="links-container"><a href="https://www.jcf.org/" target="_blank" class="info-link">Joseph Campbell Foundation</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtsNRwJVIGt6K99xRblum6w/videos" target="_blank" class="info-link">Joseph Campbell - Topic - YouTube</a></div> <div class="books-container"><p class="books-container-title">Popular Books</p> <div class="books-section"><div class="book"><p class="book-title">The Hero With a Thousand Faces (1949)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces" target="_blank" class="book-link">Wiki</a><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroWithAThousandFaces" target="_blank" class="book-link">TvTropes</a><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://archive.org/details/0691119244" target="_blank" class="book-link">File</a></div></div><div class="book"><p class="book-title">The Power of Myth (1988)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Myth" target="_blank" class="book-link">Wiki</a><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C" target="_blank" class="book-link">Google</a><!----></div></div><div class="book"><p class="book-title">Myths to Live By (1972)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myths_to_Live_By" target="_blank" class="book-link">Wiki</a><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-1IHRDgn07gC" target="_blank" class="book-link">Google</a><!----></div></div></div></div></div> <div class="quotes-container"><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">You are the Hero of your own Story.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We are standing on a whale fishing for minnows.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Instead of clearing his own heart the zealot tries to clear the world.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The best way to help mankind is through the perfection of yourself.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The job of an educator is to teach students to see vitality in themselves.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Our actual ultimate root is in our humanity, not in our personal genealogy.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">A myth is something that has never happened, but is happening all the time.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Our life evokes our character and you find out more about yourself as you go on.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I think it's important to live life with a knowledge of its mystery, and of your own mystery.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Life will always be sorrowful.

The dreadful mutilations are then seen as shadows, only, of an immanent, imperishable eternity; time yields to glory; and the world sings with the prodigious, angelic, but perhaps finally monotonous, siren music of the spheres.

That is to say, they were correct in terms of the scientific image of that age. So there must be a scientifically validated image.

But these seekers, too, are saved—by the virtue of the inherited symbolic aids of society, the rites of passage, the grace-yielding sacraments, given to mankind of old by the redeemers and handed down through the millenniums. It is only those who know neither an inner call nor an outer doctrine whose plight is truly desperate; that is to say, most of us today, in this labyrinth without and within the heart.

Eternity isn't a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. This is it. And if you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere. And the experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life. There's a wonderful formula that the Buddhists have for the Bodhisattva, the one whose being (sattva) is illumination (bodhi), who realizes his identity with eternity and at the same time his participation in time. And the attitude is not to withdraw from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but to realize that this horror is simply the foreground of a wonder and to come back and participate in it. All life is sorrowful is the first Buddhist saying, and it is. It wouldn't be life if there were not temporality involved which is sorrow.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, you have a monster state, and that's what is threatening the world at this minute. ...Certainly Star Wars has a valid mythological perspective. It shows the state as a machine and asks, 'Is the machine going to crush humanity or serve humanity?' Humanity comes not from the machine but from the heart. What I see in Star Wars is the same problem that Faust gives us: Mephistopheles, the machine man, can provide us with all the means, and is thus likely to determine the aims of life as well. But of course the characteristic of Faust, which makes him eligible to be saved, is that he seeks aims that are not those of the machine. Now, when Luke Skywalker unmasks his father, he is taking off the machine role that the father has played. The father was the uniform. That is power, the state role.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">To become—in Jung's terms—individuated, to live as a released individual, one has to know how and when to put on and to put off the masks of one's various life roles. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do,' and when at home, do not keep on the mask of the role you play in the Senate chamber. But this, finally, is not easy, since some of the masks cut deep. They include judgment and moral values. They include one's pride, ambition, and achievement. They include one's infatuations. It is a common thing to be overly impressed by and attached to masks, either some mask of one's own or the mana-masks of others. The work of individuation, however, demands that one should not be compulsively affected in this way. The aim of individuation requires that one should find and then learn to live out of one's own center, in control of one's for and against. And this cannot be achieved by enacting and responding to any general masquerade of fixed roles.</p> <!----> <!----></div></div></div> <div id="support-wrapper"><p id="support-info">
