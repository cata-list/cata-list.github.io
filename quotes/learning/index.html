It never occurs to them that information is merely a means to insight, but in itself is of little or no value.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There are great advantages in for once removing ourselves distinctly from our time and letting ourselves be driven from its shore back into the ocean of former world views. Looking at the coast from that perspective, we survey for the first time its entire shape, and when we near it again, we have the advantage of understanding it better on the whole than do those who have never left it.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The investigation of the truth is in one way hard, in another easy. An indication of this is found in the fact that no one is able to attain the truth adequately, while, on the other hand, no one fails entirely, but everyone says something true about the nature of all things, and while individually they contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable amount is amassed.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Aristotle</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Instead of developing the child's own faculties of discernment, and teaching it to judge and think for itself, the teacher uses all his energies to stuff its head full of the ready-made thoughts of other people. The mistaken views of life, which spring from a false application of general ideas, have afterwards to be corrected by long years of experience; and it is seldom that they are wholly corrected.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">If, while hurrying ostensibly to the temple of truth, we hand the reins over to our personal interests which look aside at very different guiding stars, for instance at the tastes and foibles of our contemporaries, at the established religion, but in particular at the hints and suggestions of those at the head of affairs, then how shall we ever reach the high, precipitous, bare rock whereon stands the temple of truth?</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge and get it into your power.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">So many people today — and even professional scientists — seem to me like someone who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is — in my opinion — the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Albert Einstein</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">People think of education as something that they can finish. And what's more, when they finish, it's a rite of passage. You're finished with school. You're no more a child, and therefore anything that reminds you of school - reading books, having ideas, asking questions - that's kid's stuff. Now you're an adult, you don't do that sort of thing any more. You have everybody looking forward to no longer learning, and you make them ashamed afterward of going back to learning.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Isaac Asimov</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Today, what people call learning is forced on you. Everyone is forced to learn the same thing on the same day at the same speed in class. But everyone is different. For some, class goes too fast, for some too slow, for some in the wrong direction. But give everyone a chance, in addition to school, to follow up their own bent from the start, to find out about whatever they're interested in by looking it up in their own homes, at their own speed, in their own time, and everyone will enjoy learning.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Isaac Asimov</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">For the man who studies to gain insight, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Every fact of science was once Damned. Every invention was considered impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy. Every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture and 'progress', everything on earth that is man-made and not given to us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man's refusal to bow to Authority. We would own no more, know no more, and be no more than the first apelike hominids if it were not for the rebellious, the recalcitrant, and the intransigent.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Robert Anton Wilson</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The teachers behaved like Feldwebel (sergeants). I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I wasn't worth anything, and several times they suggested I leave. I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system? ... From the age of twelve I began to suspect authority and distrust teachers.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Albert Einstein</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The gravest error a thinking person can make is to believe that one particular version of history is absolute fact. History is recorded by a series of observers, none of whom is impartial. The facts are distorted by sheer passage of time and thousands of years of humanity's dark ages, deliberate misrepresentations by religious sects, and the inevitable corruption that comes from an accumulation of careless mistakes. The wise person, then, views history as a set of lessons to be learned, choices and ramifications to be considered and discussed, and mistakes that should never again be made.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Frank Herbert</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We are in an age that assumes the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable. Consequently, society expects all earnestly responsible communication to be crisply brief... In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual's leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which, in turn, leads to war.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Bucky Fuller</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Most problems of teaching are not problems of growth but helping cultivate growth. As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested. Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested. Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds. But if children's ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don't understand.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Noam Chomsky</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Truth that has been merely learned is like an artificial limb, a false tooth, a waxen nose; at best, like a nose made out of another's flesh; it adheres to us only because it is put on. But truth acquired by thinking of our own is like a natural limb; it alone really belongs to us. This is the fundamental difference between the thinker and the mere man of learning. The intellectual attainments of a man who thinks for himself resemble a fine painting, where the light and shade are correct, the tone sustained, the colour perfectly harmonised; it is true to life. On the other hand, the intellectual attainments of the mere man of learning are like a large palette, full of all sorts of colours, which at most are systematically arranged, but devoid of harmony, connection and meaning.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Arthur Schopenhauer</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. This is what I have in mind when I recommend the humanities as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Albert Einstein</a> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">To be truly educated means to be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources available to you which you've come to appreciate and comprehend. To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question a standard doctrine if that's appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them. That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation and solidarity with others. That's what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to people who are, at least by my standards, well educated.</p> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" target="_blank" class="quote-author">Noam Chomsky</a> <!----></div></div></div> <div id="support-wrapper"><p id="support-info">
