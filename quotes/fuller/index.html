Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as 'Spaceship Earth', ephemeralization, and synergetic. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.</p> <div class="wiki-container"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Buckminster_Fuller" target="_blank" class="wiki">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller" target="_blank" class="wiki">Wikiquote</a> <!----></div> <div class="links-container"><a href="https://www.bfi.org/" target="_blank" class="info-link">The Buckminster Fuller Institute</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDCc4P6fXrjlvlS24zV8sUg/videos" target="_blank" class="info-link">Buckminster Fuller - Topic - YouTube</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070717181752/http://memeticdrift.net/bucky/index.html" target="_blank" class="info-link">'Everything I Know' Transcripts</a></div> <div class="books-container"><p class="books-container-title">Popular Books</p> <div class="books-section"><div class="book"><p class="book-title">Critical Path (1981)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path_(book)" target="_blank" class="book-link">Wiki</a><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Path-Kiyoshi-Kuromiya/dp/0312174918/?tag=mmdev-20" target="_blank" class="book-link">Amazon</a><a href="https://archive.org/details/LIBRORBuckminsterFullerCriticalPath" target="_blank" class="book-link">File</a></div></div><div class="book"><p class="book-title">Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth (1969)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Operating_Manual_for_Spaceship_Earth" target="_blank" class="book-link">Wiki</a><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Manual-Spaceship-Buckminster-Fuller/dp/3037781262/?tag=mmdev-20" target="_blank" class="book-link">Amazon</a><a href="https://fullerfuture.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/buckminsterfuller-operatingmanualforspaceshipearth.pdf" target="_blank" class="book-link">File</a></div></div><div class="book"><p class="book-title">Utopia or Oblivion: The Prospects for Humanity (1969)</p> <!----> <div class="book-links"><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eTmDDQAAQBAJ" target="_blank" class="book-link">Google</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Oblivion-Prospects-Buckminster-Fuller/dp/3037781270/?tag=mmdev-20" target="_blank" class="book-link">Amazon</a><!----></div></div></div></div></div> <div class="quotes-container"><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Dare to be naïve.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Don't fight forces, use them.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Humanity is now experiencing history's most difficult evolutionary transformation.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The minute you choose to do what you really want to do, it's a different kind of life.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We are powerfully imprisoned by the terms in which we have been conducted to think.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Traditional human power structures and their reign of darkness are about to be rendered obsolete.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There is no joy equal to that of being able to work for all humanity and doing what you're doing well.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">It is the integrity of each individual human that is in final examination.

The metaphysical is antientropic, methodically marshalling energy. Life is antientropic. It is spontaneously inquisitive. It sorts out and endeavors to understand.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important is the fact that society operates on the theory that specialization is the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">If I ran a school, I'd give the average grade to the ones who gave me all the right answers, for being good parrots.

They are socioeconomic ploys — legally enacted game-playing — agreed upon only between overwhelmingly powerful socioeconomic individuals and by them imposed upon human society and its all unwitting members.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The new human networks' emergence represents the natural evolutionary expansion into the just completed, thirty-years-in-its-buildings world-embracing, physical communications network. The new reorienting of human networking constitutes the heart-and-mind-pumped flow of life and intellect into the world arteries.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There will come a time when the proper education of children, by a glorified system of spontaneous education of choice, similar to the Montessori System, will be made possible... Education by choice, with its marvelous motivating psychology of desire for truth, will make life ever cleaner and happier, more rhythmical and artistic.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">It is one of our most exciting discoveries that local discovery leads to a complex of further discoveries. Corollary to this we find that we no sooner get a problem solved than we are overwhelmed with a multiplicity of additional problems in a most beautiful payoff of heretofore unknown, previously unrecognized, and as-yet unsolved problems.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Every child has an enormous drive to demonstrate competence. If humans are not required to earn a living to be provided survival needs, many are going to want very much to be productive, but not at those tasks they did not choose to do but were forced to accept in order to earn money. Instead, humans will spontaneously take upon themselves those tasks that world society really needs to have done.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There's a built-in resistance to letting humanity be a success. Each one claims that their system is the best one for coping with inadequacy. We have to make them all obsolete. We need to find within technology that there is something we can do which is capable of taking care of everybody, and to demonstrate that this is so. That's what geodesic domes are about and that's what my whole life has been about.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The Things to do are: the things that need doing, that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems to see need to be done. Then you will conceive your own way of doing that which needs to be done — that no one else has told you to do or how to do it. This will bring out the real you that often gets buried inside a character that has acquired a superficial array of behaviors induced or imposed by others on the individual.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Up to the Twentieth Century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, and hear. Since the initial publication of the chart of the electromagnetic spectrum, humans have learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear is less than one-millionth of reality. Ninety-nine percent of all that is going to affect our tomorrows is being developed by humans using instruments and working in ranges of reality that are nonhumanly sensible.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Neither the great political or financial powers of the world nor the population in general realize that the engineering-chemical-electronic revolution now makes it possible to produce many more technical devices with ever less material. We can now take care of everybody at a higher standard of living than anybody has ever known. It does not have to be you or me, so selfishness is unnecessary and war is obsolete. This has never been done before.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The words synergy (syn-ergy) and energy (en-ergy) are companions. Energy studies are familiar. Energy relates to differentiating out subfunctions of nature, studying objects isolated out of the whole complex of Universe—for instance, studying soil minerals without consideration of hydraulics or of plant genetics. But synergy represents the integrated behaviors instead of all the differentiated behaviors of nature's galaxy systems and galaxy of galaxies.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I am convinced that human continuance depends entirely upon: the intuitive wisdom of each and every individual... the individual's integrity of speaking and acting only on the individual's own within-self-intuited and reasoned initiative ... the individual's never joining action with others as motivated only by crowd-engendered-emotionalism, or a sense of the crowd's power to overwhelm, or in fear of holding to the course indicated by one's own intellectual convictions.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I am enthusiastic over humanity's extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuity. If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday's fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only means for solving a given problem.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I have to say, I think that we are in some kind of final examination as to whether human beings now, with this capability to acquire information and to communicate, whether we're really qualified to take on the responsibility we're designed to be entrusted with. And this is not a matter of an examination of the types of governments, nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with economic systems. It has to do with the individual. Does the individual have the courage to really go along with the truth?</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The dark ages still reign over all humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. This Dark Ages prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by misorientation and built of misinformation. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt meagerly to compete with God. All are intractably skeptical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these Dark Ages simply by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We are in an age that assumes the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable. Consequently, society expects all earnestly responsible communication to be crisply brief... In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual's leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which, in turn, leads to war.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">When I was born, humanity was 95 per cent illiterate. Since I've been born, the population has doubled and that total population is now 65 per cent literate. That's a gain of 130-fold of the literacy. When humanity is primarily illiterate, it needs leaders to understand and get the information and deal with it. When we are at the point where the majority of humans them-selves are literate, able to get the information, we're in an entirely new relationship to Universe. We are at the point where the integrity of the individual counts and not what the political leadership or the religious leadership says to do.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">In spite of all humans' innate interest in the interrelatedness of all experience, long ago these world-power-structure builders learned to shunt all the bright intellectuals and the physically creative into specialist careers. The powerful reserved for themselves the far easier, because innate, comprehensive functioning. All one needs to do is to discover how self-perpetuating is this disease of specialization is to witness the inter-departmental battling for educational funds and the concomitant jealous guarding of the various specializations assigned to a department's salaried experts on each subject in any university.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There are progressive degrees of synergy, called synergy-of-synergies, which are complexes of behavior aggregates holistically unpredicted by the separate behaviors of any of their subcomplex components. Any subcomplex aggregate is only a component aggregation of an even greater event aggregation whose comprehensive behaviors are never predicted by the component aggregates alone. There is a synergetic progression in Universe—a hierarchy of total complex behaviors entirely unpredicted by their successive subcomplexes' behaviors. It is manifest that Universe is the maximum synergy-of-synergies, being utterly unpredicted by any of its parts.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The youth of humanity all around our planet are intuitively revolting from all sovereignties and political ideologies. The youth of Earth are moving intuitively toward an utterly classless, raceless, omnicooperative, omniworld humanity. Children freed of the ignorantly founded educational traditions and exposed only to their spontaneously summoned, computer-stored and -distributed outflow of reliable-opinion-purged, experimentally verified data, shall indeed lead society to its happy egress from all misinformedly conceived, fearfully and legally imposed, and physically enforced customs of yesterday. They can lead all humanity into omnisuccessful survival as well as entrance into an utterly new era of human experience in an as-yet and ever-will-be fundamentally mysterious Universe.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There is more recognition now that things are changing, but not because there is a political move to do it. It is simply a result of the information being there. Our survival won't depend on political or economic systems. It's going to depend on the courage of the individual to speak the truth, and to speak it lovingly and not destructively. It's saying what you really know and feel is the truth, in all directions. Our greatest vulnerability lies in the amount of misinformation and misconditioning of humanity. I've found the educations systems are full of it. You have to examine each word and ask yourself, Is that the right word for that? — the integrity and the courage of the individual to speak his own truth and not to go along with the crowd, yet not making others seem ignorant. After a while, if enough human beings are doing it, then everybody will start going in the right direction.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Humanity is moving ever deeper into a crisis which has no precedent. It is a crisis brought about by evolution being intent on completely integrating differently colored, differently cultured, and intercommunicating humanity, and by evolution being intent on making integrated humanity able to live sustainedly at a higher standard of living for all than has ever been experienced by any. Probably ninety-nine percent of humanity does not know that we have the option to make it ; we do. It can only be accomplished, however, through a Design Science Revolution. Those in supreme power, politically and economically, aren't yet convinced that our Planet Earth has anywhere nearly enough life support for all humanity. They assume it has to be either you or me, that there is not enough for both. Those with financial advantage reason that selfishness is necessary and fortify themselves even further.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">This is not a visible revolution and it is not political. You're dealing with the invisible world of technology. Politics is absolutely hopeless. That's why everything has gone wrong. You have ninety-nine percent of the people thinking politics, and hollering and yelling. And that won't get you anywhere. Hollering and yelling won't get you across the English Channel. It won't reach from continent to continent; you need electronics for that, and you have to know what you're doing. Evolution has been at work doing all these things so it is now possible. Nobody has consciously been doing it. The universe is a lot bigger than you and me. We didn't invent it. If you take all the machinery in the world and dump it in the ocean, within months more than half of all humanity will die and within another six months they'd almost all be gone; if you took all the politicians in the world, put them in a rocket, and sent them to the moon, everyone would get along fine.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Our school systems are all nonsynergetic. We take the whole child and fractionate the scope of his or her comprehending coordination by putting the children in elementary schools—to become preoccupied with elements or isolated facts only. Thereafter we force them to choose some specialization, forcing them to forget the whole. ... We may well ask how it happened that the entire scheme of advanced education is devoted exclusively to ever narrower specialization. We find that the historical beginnings of schools and tutoring were established, and economically supported by illiterate and vastly ambitious warlords who required a wide variety of brain slaves with which to logistically and ballistically overwhelm those who opposed their expansion of physical conquest. They also simultaneously DIVIDED and CONQUERED any and all bright ones who might otherwise rise within their realms to threaten their supremacy. The warlord vitiated their threat by making them all specialists and reserving to himself exclusively the right to think about and act comprehensively. The warlord made all those about him differentiators and reserved the function of integration to himself.</p> <!----> <!----></div></div></div> <div id="support-wrapper"><p id="support-info">
