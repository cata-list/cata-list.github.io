We think in words. Language is the landscape of thought.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Some people have no idea what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Hallucinogens are a value changer... like it or not.

When you're born in America, you get a front row seat.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Humor is based on surprise, and surprise is a milder way of saying shock. It's surprise that makes the joke.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Don't just teach children to read… Teach them to question what they read. Teach them to question everything.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">For a while, I thought of myself as an atheist until I realized it was a belief, too. It's a shame everything has to have a label.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">If it's true that our species is alone in the universe, then I'd have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I also survived circumcision, a barbaric practice designed to remind you as early as possible that your genitals are not your own.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I don't have to tell you it goes without saying there are some things better left unsaid. I think that speaks for itself. The less said about it the better.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I don't believe there's any problem in this country, no matter how tough it is, that Americans, when they roll up their sleeves, can't completely ignore.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">You know, if a drug has anything going for it at all, it should be self-limiting. It should tell you when you've had enough. Acid and peyote were that way for me.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Some people see things that are and ask, Why?

What you should tell them is, 'Maybe not. But there is an I in independence, individuality and integrity.'</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Fuck the drug war. Dropping acid was a profound turning point for me, a seminal experience. I make no apologies for it. More people should do acid. It should be sold over the counter.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Language is the most elementary aspect to our humanness, probably. In addition to that, it's the embodiment, it's the apotheosis of the human experience, it's the way we summarize ourselves.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I think we're part of a greater wisdom that we will ever understand; a higher order, call it what you want. Know what I call it? The Big Electron. It doesn't punish, it doesn't reward, it doesn't judge at all. It just is.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Every time you're exposed to advertising in America you're reminded that this country's most profitable business is still the manufacture, packaging, distribution, and marketing of bullshit. High-quality, grade-A, prime-cut, pure American bullshit.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Pride should be reserved for something you achieve or obtain on your own, not something that happens by accident of birth. Being Irish isn't a skill... it's a fucking genetic accident. You wouldn't say I'm proud to have a pre-disposition for colon cancer.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I respect animals. I have more sympathy for an injured or dead animal than I do for an injured or dead human being, because human beings participate and cooperate in their own undoing. Animals are completely innocent. There are no innocent human beings.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">One of the interesting things about 'outsidership' is that underneath it there's a longing to belong. I just wish the thing I refused to belong to the species, Western capital culture was a little more respectable. My one true relaxation is my flotation tank, in which I can either meditate or just drift off.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Someone once said, if you scratch a cynic, and you'll find a disappointed idealist. That really rang a bell with me because I recognized that, within me, there is this flame, of wishing it were better, wishing people had better lives, that there was more of an authentic sharing and harmony with nature.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Military cemeteries around the world are packed with brainwashed dead soldiers who were convinced God was on their side. America prays for God to destroy our enemies. Our enemies pray for God to destroy us. Somebody's gonna be disappointed! Somebody's wasting their time! Could it be.. everyone?</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Question everything you read or hear or see or are told. Question it, and try to see the world for what it actually is, as opposed to what someone or some company or some organization or some government is trying to represent it as, or present it as, however they've mislabeled it or dressed it up or told you.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">No matter how you care to define it, I do not identify with the local group. Planet, species, race, nation, state, religion, party, union, club, association, neighborhood improvement committee; I have no interest in any of it. I love and treasure individuals as I meet them, I loathe and despise the groups they identify with and belong to.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">No one is ever more him/herself than when they really laugh. Their defenses are down. It's very Zen-like, that moment. They are completely open, completely themselves when that message hits the brain and the laugh begins. That's when new ideas can be implanted. If a new idea slips in at that moment, it has a chance to grow.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">As much as I love my family, I enjoy it when the house is empty, because then I know I'm truly alone, as we all are on the planet, after all. Every atom in us is originally from a star. And during my moments of aloneness, I'm most mindful of that; that I'm just another group of matter randomly but wonderfully arranged. That's when I feel my immortality.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">A person of good intelligence and of sensitivity cannot exist in this society very long without having some anger about the inequality and it's not just a bleeding-heart, knee-jerk, liberal kind of a thing it is just a normal human reaction to a nonsensical set of values where we have cinnamon flavored dental floss and there are people sleeping in the street.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Did you ever stop to thnk about all the people we kill? They're always people who tell us to live together in harmony and try to love one another: Jesus, Ghandi, Lincoln, John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, John Lennon. They all said: 'Try to live together peacefully.' BAM! Right in the fuckin' head! Apparently we're not ready for that!</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate a group of people with a 'common purpose'. 'Cause pretty soon they have little hats. And armbands. And fight songs. And a list of people they're going to visit at 3am. So, I dislike and despise groups of people but I love individuals. Every person you look at; you can see the universe in their eyes, if you're really looking.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch tv too much. We have multiplied our possessions but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living but not a life. We've added years to life, not life to years.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Primitive societies, or social groupings, had shamans, and some of them even more recent in time. Shamans were tricksters. There was a tradition of the trickster, and the trickster was a clown, a humorous fellow. His task was to trick the gods, to humor the gods into laughing, so that there was access to the divine because laughter is a moment when we are completely ourselves.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The limits of debate are established in this country before the debate even begins. Everybody else is marginalized, made to seem like Communists or some other disloyal person. 'Kook,' there's a word! Now it's 'conspiracy.' They've made that something that can't even be entertained for a minute – that powerful people might get together and have a plan? Doesn't happen! You're a kook, you're a conspiracy buff!</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules. I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination. I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">When you're in front of an audience and you make them laugh at a new idea, you're guiding the whole being for the moment. No one is ever more him/herself than when they really laugh. Their defenses are down. It's very Zen-like, that moment. They are completely open, completely themselves when that message hits the brain and the laugh begins. That's when new ideas can be implanted. If a new idea slips in at that moment, it has a chance to grow.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Keep in mind, the news media are not independent; they are a sort of bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class-the people who run things. Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by, and tolerated purely at the whim of, those who hold economic power. If the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something, it won't be on the news. Period. Or, at the very least, it will be slanted to suit them, and then rarely followed up.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The larger the group, the more toxic, the more of your beauty as an individual you have to surrender for the sake of group thought. And when you suspend your individual beauty you also give up a lot of your humanity. You will do things in the name of a group that you would never do on your own. Injuring, hurting, killing, drinking are all part of it, because you've lost your identity, because you now owe your allegiance to this thing that's bigger than you are and that controls you.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Early in my career I was divided because I had the real self underneath: the lawbreaker, the anarchist, the person who swims against the tide, the outsider, the loner, all of that guy. He was my private self, and I had this other side that wanted to be liked in order to do all those things I dreamed of as a little boy. I didn't realize that those things didn't go together until later. And I'm quite sure that my use of acid and peyote helped me accept what was really going on inside of me instead of what I had imposed on myself.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Have you ever noticed that the only metaphor we have in our public discourse for solving problems is to declare war on it? We have the war on crime, the war on cancer, the war on drugs. But did you ever notice that we have no war on homelessness? You know why? Because there's no money in that problem. No money to be made off of the homeless. If you can find a solution to homelessness where the corporations and politicians can make a few million dollars each, you will see the streets of America begin to clear up pretty damn quick!</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Someone said, and rightfully, that 'property is theft'. There's no way a man can stand and tell me that he owns an apple tree. I just don't believe you. And so this pursuit of position and money and power, they are all wrapped up into one package that I think is crippling, debilitating and limiting. And unfortunately, people get sucked into it and then they've got you on the treadmill. You know: 'You've got to have a good job' and 'You've got to have a good education' which is another word for indoctrination. We're never going to rise above these limitations we've placed on ourselves.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">The reason I prefer the sledgehammer to the rapier and the reason I believe in blunt, violent, confrontational forms for the presentation of my ideas is because I see that what's happening to the lives of people is not rapierlike, it is not gentle, it is not subtle. It is direct, hard and violent. The slow violence of poverty, the slow violence of untreated disease. Of unemployment, hunger, discrimination. This isn't the violence of some guy opening fire with an Uzi in a McDonald's and forty people are dead. The real violence that goes on every day, unheard, unreported, over and over, multiplied a millionfold.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Governments don't want a population capable of critical thinking, they want obedient workers, people just smart enough to run the machines and just dumb enough to passively accept their situation.You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">I don't like ass kissers, flag wavers or team players. I like people who buck the system. Individualists. I often warn people: 'Somewhere along the way, someone is going to tell you, 'There is no 'I' in team.' What you should tell them is, 'Maybe not. But there is an 'I' in independence, individuality and integrity.'' Avoid teams at all cost. Keep your circle small. Never join a group that has a name. And if, somehow, you must join, if it's unavoidable, such as a union or a trade association, go ahead and join. But don't participate; it will be your death. And if they tell you you're not a team player, congratulate them on being observant.</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. Fuck Hope.'</p> <!----> <!----></div><div class="quote"><p class="quote-text">There's a reason education sucks, and it's the same reason it will never ever ever be fixed. It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you've got.. because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.. the real owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations that've long since bought and paid for, the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and the information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them.</p> <!----> <!----></div></div></div> <div id="support-wrapper"><p id="support-info">
