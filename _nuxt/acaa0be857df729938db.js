They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them.

Indeed, the whole of our social arrangements may be likened to a perpetual comedy; and this is why a man who is worth anything finds society so insipid, while a blockhead is quite at home in it.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Isn\'t it sad that you can tell people that the ozone layer is being depleted, the forests are being cut down, the deserts are advancing steadily, that the greenhouse effect will raise the sea level 200 feet, that overpopulation is choking us, that pollution is killing us, that nuclear war may destroy us - and they yawn and settle back for a comfortable nap. But tell them that the Martians are landing, and they scream and run.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"Somebody who reads only newspapers and at best books of contemporary authors appears to me like an extremely near-sighted person who scorns eyeglasses. He is completely dependent on the prejudices and fashions of his times, since he never gets to see or hear anything else. And what a person thinks on his own, without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people, is, similarly, even in the best case rather paltry and monotonous.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"When I was in high school I asked myself at one point: \'Why do I care if my high school\'s team wins the football game? I don\'t know anybody on the team, they have nothing to do with me... why am I here and applaud? It does not make any sense.\' But the point is, it does make sense: It\'s a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority and group cohesion behind leadership elements. In fact it\'s training in irrational jingoism. That\'s also a feature of competitive sports.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"The inexperienced in wisdom and virtue, ever occupied with feasting and such, are carried downward, and there, as is fitting, they wander their whole life long, neither ever looking upward to the truth above them nor rising toward it, nor tasting pure and lasting pleasures. Like cattle, always looking downward with their heads bent toward the ground and the banquet tables, they feed, fatten, and fornicate. In order to increase their possessions they kick and butt with horns and hoofs of steel and kill each other, insatiable as they are.","author":"Socrates","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Socrates"},{"quote":"A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful. The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"Mass education was designed to turn independent farmers into docile, passive tools of production. That was its primary purpose. And don\'t think people didn\'t know it. They knew it and they fought against it. There was a lot of resistance to mass education for exactly that reason. It was also understood by the elites. The anti-democratic thrust of opinion in what are called democratic societies is really ferocious. And for good reason. Because the freer the society gets, the more dangerous the great beast becomes and the more you have to be careful to cage it somehow.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"It is really incredible how meaningless and insignificant when seen from without, and how dull and senseless when felt from within, is the course of life of the great majority of men. It is weary longing and worrying, a dreamlike staggering through the four ages of life to death, accompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. They are like clockwork that is wound up and goes without knowing why. Every time a man is begotten and born the clock of human life is wound up anew, to repeat once more its same old tune that has already been played innumerable times, movement by movement and measure by measure, with insignificant variations.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Ordinary society is, in this respect, very like the kind of music to be obtained from an orchestra composed of Russian horns. Each horn has only one note; and the music is produced by each note coming in just at the right moment. In the monotonous sound of a single horn, you have a precise illustration of the effect of most people\'s minds. How often there seems to be only one thought there! and no room for any other. It is easy to see why people are so bored; and also why they are sociable, why they like to go about in crowds—why mankind is so gregarious. It is the monotony of his own nature that makes a man find solitude intolerable.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Early theorists of group psychology had tried to explain why men were so sheeplike when they functioned in groups. They developed ideal like \'mental contagion\' and \'herd instinct,\' which became very popular. But as Freud was quick to see, these ideas never really did explain what men did with their judgment and common sense when they got caught up in groups. Freud saw right away what they did with it: they simply became dependent children again, blindly following the inner voice of their parents, which now came to them under the hypnotic spell of the leader. They abandoned their egos to his, identified with his power, tried to function with him as an ideal.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"},{"quote":"The result of this mental dullness is that inner vacuity and emptiness that is stamped on innumerable faces and also betrays itself in a constant and lively attention to all events in the external world, even the most trivial. This vacuity is the real source of boredom and always craves for external excitement in order to set the mind and spirits in motion through something. Therefore in the choice thereof it is not fastidious, as is testified by the miserable and wretched pastimes to which people have recourse. … The principal result of this inner vacuity is the craze for society, diversion, amusement, and luxury of every kind which lead many to extravagance and so to misery.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"I consider that the matter of defining what is real — that is a serious topic, even a vital topic. And in there somewhere is the other topic, the definition of the authentic human. Because the bombardment of pseudo- realities begins to produce inauthentic humans very quickly, spurious humans — as fake as the data pressing at them from all sides. My two topics are really one topic; they unite at this point. Fake realities will create fake humans. Or, fake humans will generate fake realities and then sell them to other humans, turning them, eventually, into forgeries of themselves. So we wind up with fake humans inventing fake realities and then peddling them to other fake humans. It is just a very large version of Disneyland.","author":"Philip K. Dick","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick"},{"quote":"In so far as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish the illusion of individuality, but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized.

The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree\'s growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. Without the living tree, the image of the pine is only a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the realization of this uniqueness in the individual man is the goal of the process of individuation.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"By the time the child grows up, the inverted search for a personal existence through perversity gets set in an individual mold, and it becomes more secret. It has to be secret because the community won\'t stand for the attempt by people to wholly individualize themselves. If there is going to be a victory over human incompleteness and limitation, it has to be a social project and not an individual one. Society wants to be the one to decide how people are to transcend death; it will tolerate the causa-sui project only if it fits into the standard social project.

They are \'inauthentic\' in that they do not belong to themselves, are not \'their own\' person, do not act from their own center, do not see reality on its terms; they are the one-dimensional men totally immersed in the fictional games being played in their society, unable to transcend their social conditioning: the corporation men in the West, the bureaucrats in the East, the tribal men locked up in tradition-man everywhere who doesn\'t understand what it means to think for himself and who, if he did, would shrink back at the idea of such audacity and exposure.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"},{"quote":"In his heart every man knows quite well that, being unique, he will be in the world only once and that no imaginable chance will for a second time gather together into a unity so strangely variegated an assortment as he is: he knows it but he hides it like a bad conscience—why? From fear of his neighbor, who demands conventionality and cloaks himself with it. But what is it that constrains the individual to fear his neighbor, to think and act like a member of a herd, and to have no joy in himself? Modesty, perhaps, in a few rare cases. With the great majority it is indolence, inertia. … Men are even lazier than they are timid, and fear most of all the inconveniences with which unconditional honesty and nakedness would burden them. Artists alone hate this sluggish promenading in borrowed fashions and appropriated opinions and they reveal everyone\'s secret bad conscience, the law that every man is a unique miracle.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"To become—in Jung\'s terms—individuated, to live as a released individual, one has to know how and when to put on and to put off the masks of one\'s various life roles. \'When in Rome, do as the Romans do,\' and when at home, do not keep on the mask of the role you play in the Senate chamber. But this, finally, is not easy, since some of the masks cut deep. They include judgment and moral values. They include one\'s pride, ambition, and achievement. They include one\'s infatuations. It is a common thing to be overly impressed by and attached to masks, either some mask of one\'s own or the mana-masks of others. The work of individuation, however, demands that one should not be compulsively affected in this way. The aim of individuation requires that one should find and then learn to live out of one\'s own center, in control of one\'s for and against. And this cannot be achieved by enacting and responding to any general masquerade of fixed roles.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"No difference of rank, position, or birth is so great as the gulf that spearates the countless millions who use their head only in the service of their belly, in other words, look upon it as an instrument of the will, and those very few and rare persons who have the courage to say: \'No! It is too good for that; my head shall be active only in its own service; it shall try to comprehend the wondrous and varied spectacle of this world\', and then reproduce it in some form, whether as art or as literature, that may answer to my character as an individual. These are the truly noble, the real noblesse of the world. The others are serfs and go with the soil. Of course, I am here referring to those who have not only the courage, but also the call, and therfore the right, to order the head to quit the service of the will; with a result that proves the sacrifice to have been worth the making. In the case of those to whom all this can only partially apply, the gulf is not so wide; but even though their talent be small, so long as it is real, there will always be a sharp line of demarcation between them and the millions.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"The fact that a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing... He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths... There are not a few who are called awake by the summons of the voice, whereupon they are at once set apart from the others, feeling themselves confronted with a problem about which the others know nothing. In most cases it is impossible to explain to the others what has happened, for any understanding is walled off by impenetrable prejudices. \'You are no different from anybody else,\' they will chorus or, \'there\'s no such thing\', and even if there is such a thing, it is immediately branded as \'morbid\'... He is at once set apart and isolated, as he has resolved to obey the law that commands him from within. \'His own law!\' everybody will cry. But he knows better: it is the law...The only meaningful life is a life that strives for the individual realization--absolute and unconditional--of its own particular law...To the extent that a man is untrue to the law of his being...he has failed to realize his own life\'s meaning. The undiscovered vein within us is a living part of the psyche; classical Chinese philosophy names this interior way \'Tao\', and likens it to a flow of water that moves irresistibly towards its goal. To rest in Tao means fulfillment, wholeness, one\'s destination reached, one\'s mission done; the beginning, end, and perfect realization of the meaning of existence innate in all things.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"There is the type of man who has great contempt for \'immediacy\', who tries to cultivate his interiority, base his pride on something deeper and inner, create a distance between himself and the average man. Kierkegaard calls this type of man the \'introvert.\' He is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, with individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and withdraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret self, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, is the only real problem of life, the only worthwhile occupation preoccupation of man: What is one\'s true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In what way is one truly unique, and how can he express this uniqueness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How can the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that he feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings, and use them to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and mankind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In adolescence, most of us throb with this dilemma, expressing it either with words and thoughts or with simple numb pain and longing. But usually life suck us up into standardized activities. The social hero-system into which we are born marks out paths for our heroism, paths to which we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working our inner secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we become purely external men, playing successfully the standardized hero-game into which we happen to fall by accident, by family connection, by reflex patriotism, or by the simple need to eat and the urge to procreate.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"}]},{"name":"Purpose","slug":"purpose","quotes":[{"quote":"You are the Hero of your own Story.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"Happiness belongs to the self-sufficient.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"We are the ones we have been waiting for.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.","author":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"},{"quote":"Freedom is obedience to self-formulated rules.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"The first and best victory is to conquer self.","author":"Plato","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Plato"},{"quote":"Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth.","author":"Epicurus","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Epicurus"},{"quote":"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Every man is guilty of all the good he did not do.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"True nobility is being superior to your former self.","author":"Ernest Hemingway","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway"},{"quote":"Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength.","author":"Sigmund Freud","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud"},{"quote":"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"Chiefly the mold of a man\'s fortune is in his own hands.","author":"Francis Bacon","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"},{"quote":"In an evolving world, he who stands still moves backward.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"He who has a \'Why?\' in life can tolerate almost any \'How?\'.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"If you want to overcome the whole world, overcome yourself.","author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky"},{"quote":"Fortune is powerless to help one who does not exert himself.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"The problem is not to find the answer, it\'s to face the answer.","author":"Terence McKenna","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna"},{"quote":"You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"You must have a plan or you will become a part of someone else\'s.","author":"Terence McKenna","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna"},{"quote":"The troubles of modern life come from being divorced from nature.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"The best way to help mankind is through the perfection of yourself.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"The best contribution one can make to humanity is to improve oneself.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"Men exist for the sake of one another.

This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know. For the human organism is, apparently, the most complex of all organisms, and while one has the advantage of knowing one\'s own organism so intimately—from the inside—there is also the disadvantage of being so close to it that one can never quite get at it.

By realizing the truth of his situation, by dispelling the lie of his character, by breaking his spirit out of its conditioned prison. The enemy, for Kierkegaard as for Freud, is the Oedipus complex. The child has built up strategies and techniques for keeping his self-esteem in the face of the terror of his situation. These techniques become an armor that hold the person prisoner. The very defenses that he needs in order to move about with self-confidence and self-esteem become his life-long trap. In order to transcend himself he must break down that which he needs in order to live. Like Lear he must throw off all his \'cultural lendings\' and stand naked in the storm of life. Kierkegaard had no illusions about man\'s urge to freedom. He knew how comfortable people were inside the prison of their character defenses. Like many prisoners they are comfortable in their limited and protected routines, and the idea of a parole into the wide world of chance, accident, and choice terrifies them.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"}]},{"name":"Government","slug":"government","quotes":[{"quote":"War is murder writ large.","author":"Carl Sagan","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"},{"quote":"Nationalism is an infantile disease.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Force always attracts men of low morality.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Bureaucracy is the death of all sound work.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Poverty is the parent of revolution and crime.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.","author":"Thomas Jefferson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"},{"quote":"Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"You don\'t need a formal conspiracy when interests converge.","author":"George Carlin","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Carlin"},{"quote":"Laws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.","author":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn"},{"quote":"A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"Man exists for his own sake and not to add a laborer to the state.","author":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"},{"quote":"A State can be no better than the citizens of which it is composed.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"Naturally, any conqueror is going to play one group against another.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"Nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise.","author":"Francis Bacon","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"},{"quote":"Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.","author":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn"},{"quote":"Which is the best government?

That is what apocalypse means – revelation. I could square that with the end of the world, a revelation, a new way of looking at things, something that completely radicalises our notions of the where we were, when we were, what we were, something like that would constitute an end to the world in the kind of abstract – yet very real sense – that I am talking about.

I think the world is purely a construction of ideas, and not just the physical structures, but the mental structures, the ideologies that we\'ve erected, that is what I would call the world. Our political structures, philosophical structures, ideological frameworks, economies. These are actually imaginary things, and yet that is the framework that we have built our entire world upon. It strikes me that a strong enough wave of information could completely overturn and destroy all of that. A sudden realization that would change our entire perspective upon who we are and how we exist. History is a heat, it is the heat of accumulated information and accumulated complexity.

An indication of this is found in the fact that no one is able to attain the truth adequately, while, on the other hand, no one fails entirely, but everyone says something true about the nature of all things, and while individually they contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable amount is amassed.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Instead of developing the child\'s own faculties of discernment, and teaching it to judge and think for itself, the teacher uses all his energies to stuff its head full of the ready-made thoughts of other people.

Every invention was considered impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy. Every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture and \'progress\', everything on earth that is man-made and not given to us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man\'s refusal to bow to Authority. We would own no more, know no more, and be no more than the first apelike hominids if it were not for the rebellious, the recalcitrant, and the intransigent.","author":"Robert Anton Wilson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson"},{"quote":"What an astonishing thing a book is. It\'s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you\'re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.","author":"Carl Sagan","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"},{"quote":"The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. Public libraries depend on voluntary contributions. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.","author":"Carl Sagan","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"},{"quote":"School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The teachers behaved like Feldwebel (sergeants). I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I wasn\'t worth anything, and several times they suggested I leave. I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system? ... From the age of twelve I began to suspect authority and distrust teachers.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"The gravest error a thinking person can make is to believe that one particular version of history is absolute fact. History is recorded by a series of observers, none of whom is impartial. The facts are distorted by sheer passage of time and thousands of years of humanity\'s dark ages, deliberate misrepresentations by religious sects, and the inevitable corruption that comes from an accumulation of careless mistakes. The wise person, then, views history as a set of lessons to be learned, choices and ramifications to be considered and discussed, and mistakes that should never again be made.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"We are in an age that assumes the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable. Consequently, society expects all earnestly responsible communication to be crisply brief... In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual\'s leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which, in turn, leads to war.","author":"Bucky Fuller","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller"},{"quote":"Most problems of teaching are not problems of growth but helping cultivate growth. As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested. Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested. Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds. But if children\'s ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don\'t understand.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"Truth that has been merely learned is like an artificial limb, a false tooth, a waxen nose; at best, like a nose made out of another\'s flesh; it adheres to us only because it is put on. But truth acquired by thinking of our own is like a natural limb; it alone really belongs to us. This is the fundamental difference between the thinker and the mere man of learning. The intellectual attainments of a man who thinks for himself resemble a fine painting, where the light and shade are correct, the tone sustained, the colour perfectly harmonised; it is true to life. On the other hand, the intellectual attainments of the mere man of learning are like a large palette, full of all sorts of colours, which at most are systematically arranged, but devoid of harmony, connection and meaning.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. This is what I have in mind when I recommend the humanities as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"To be truly educated means to be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources available to you which you\'ve come to appreciate and comprehend. To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question a standard doctrine if that\'s appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them. That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation and solidarity with others. That\'s what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to people who are, at least by my standards, well educated.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"}]},{"name":"Spirituality","slug":"spirituality","quotes":[{"quote":"Matter is composed chiefly of nothing.","author":"Carl Sagan","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"},{"quote":"Everything that is possible demands to exist.","author":"Gottfried Leibniz","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz"},{"quote":"Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"The wise through excess of wisdom is made a fool.","author":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"},{"quote":"I... a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.","author":"Richard Feynman","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman"},{"quote":"There is strong shadow where there is much light.","author":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe"},{"quote":"Life is a mask through which the universe expresses itself.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"Reality is merely an illusion.

Magic is closer to anarchism.","author":"Alan Moore","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Moore"},{"quote":"We do not come into this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree.

It is the ultimate void where no preordained screens occur upon which forms may be projected. You have only one awareness here—the screen of the magi: Imagination!

No matter how deeply one immerses oneself in work, a haunting feeling of inescapable tragedy persists. Still, there are moments when one feels free from one\'s own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"In many cultures, the customary answer is that a God or Gods created the Universe out of nothing. But if we wish to pursue this question courageously, we must of course ask the next question: where did God come from? If we decide that this is an unanswerable question, why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the Universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God always existed, why not save a step, and conclude that the Universe always existed? That there\'s no need for a creation, it was always here. These are not easy questions. Cosmology brings us face to face with the deepest mysteries, questions that were once treated only in religion and myth.","author":"Carl Sagan","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"},{"quote":"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery — even if mixed with fear — that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success but in the quest for worthy spiritual growth. Our entire earthly existence is but a transitional stage in the movement toward something higher, and we must not stumble and fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung of the ladder. Material laws alone do not explain our life or give it direction. The laws of physics and physiology will never reveal the indisputable manner in which the Creator constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die.

And these, with all their beast-heats, crowns and lightings, all their different colors, are become combined into the single whiteness that is godhead; that is all. This, then, is revelation.

This is understood as being the Great Work, as being the gold the alchemists sought, as being the Will, the Soul, the thing we have inside us that is behind the intellect, the body, the dreams. The inner dynamo of us, if you like. Now this is the single most important thing that we can ever attain, the knowledge of our own Self. And yet there are a frightening amount of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the Self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. This is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness, because it\'s too much of a responsibility to actually posses such a thing as a soul, such a precious thing. What if you break it? What if you lose it? Mightn\'t it be best to anesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure? I think that the way that people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up, can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher Self and then having to maintain it.","author":"Alan Moore","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Moore"}]},{"name":"Albert Einstein","slug":"einstein","bio":"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity.

Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thoroughgoing an association as possible.

I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.","source":""},{"quote":"One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one\'s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought. With this negative motive goes a positive one. Man seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling personal experience.","source":""},{"quote":"It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. This is what I have in mind when I recommend the humanities as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.","source":""},{"quote":"The world needs new moral impulses which, I\'m afraid, won\'t come from the churches, heavily compromised as they have been throughout the centuries. Perhaps those impulses must come from scientists in the tradition of Galileo, Kepler and Newton. In spite of failures and persecutions, these men devoted their lives to proving that the universe is a single entity, in which, I believe, a humanized God has no place. The genuine scientist is not moved by praise or blame, nor does he preach. He unveils the universe and people come eagerly, without being pushed, to behold a new revelation: the order, the harmony, the magnificence of creation! And as man becomes conscious of the stupendous laws that govern the universe in perfect harmony, he begins to realize how small he is. He sees the pettiness of human existence, with its ambitions and intrigues, its \'I am better than thou\' creed. This is the beginning of cosmic religion within him; fellowship and human service become his moral code.

Only exceptionally gifted individuals or especially noble communities rise essentially above this level; in these there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development—for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism, as, in particular, Schopenhauer\'s magnificent essays have shown us. The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man\'s image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints","source":""}]},{"name":"Arthur Schopenhauer","slug":"schopenhauer","bio":"Arthur Schopenhauer was a German philosopher whose work has had an impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science.

Herein they are like little dogs; if anything stirs, they immediately set up a shrill bark.

It isn\'t money, for genius seldom gets any. It isn\'t fame: fame is too uncertain and, more closely considered, of too little worth. Nor is it strictly for its own pleasure, for the great exertion involved almost outweighs the pleasure. It is rather an instinct of a unique sort by virtue of which the individual possessed of genius is impelled to express what he has seen and felt in enduring works without being conscious of any further motivation.

It is not long before they must yield their place; nay, the light they give is reflected only, and the sphere of their influence is confined to their orbit — their contemporaries. Their path is one of change and movement, and with the circuit of a few years their tale is told. Fixed stars are the only ones that are constant; their position in the firmament is secure; they shine with a light of their own; their effect today is the same as it was yesterday, because, having no parallax, their appearance does not alter with a difference in our standpoint.

Therefore in the choice thereof it is not fastidious, as is testified by the miserable and wretched pastimes to which people have recourse. … The principal result of this inner vacuity is the craze for society, diversion, amusement, and luxury of every kind which lead many to extravagance and so to misery.

Only as a secondary consideration does he hope that some benefit may accrue to himself from the transformed substance as the panacea, the medicina catholica, just as it may to the imperfect bodies, the base or \'sick\' metals, etc. His attention is not directed to his own salvation through God\'s grace, but to the liberation of God from the darkness of matter.","source":""},{"quote":"The greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They can never be solved, but only outgrown. This \'outgrowing\', as I formerly called it, on further experience was seen to consist in a new level of consciousness. Some higher or wider interest arose on the person\'s horizon, and through this widening of view, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its own terms, but faded out when confronted with a new and stronger life-tendency.","source":""},{"quote":"In psychology it is very important that the doctor should not strive to heal at all costs. One has to be exceedingly careful not to impose one\'s own will and conviction on the patient. You have to give him a certain amount of freedom.

Sometimes it is really a question whether you are allowed to rescue a man from the fate he must undergo for the sake of his further development.","source":""},{"quote":"It is my mind, with its store of images, that gives the world color and sound; and that supremely real and rational certainty which I can \'experience\' is, in its most simple form, an exceedingly complicated structure of mental images. Thus there is, in a certain sense, nothing that is directly experienced except the mind itself. Everything is mediated through the mind, translated, filtered, allegorized, twisted, even falsified by it. We are... enveloped in a cloud of changing and endlessly shifting images.","source":""},{"quote":"The creative process, so far as we are able to follow it at all, consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life. Therein lies the social significance of art: it is constantly at work educating the spirit of the age, conjuring up the forms in which the age is most lacking.","source":""},{"quote":"Anthropologists have often described what happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization. Its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood what we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were more interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present.","source":""},{"quote":"The present day shows with appalling clarity how little able people are to let the other man\'s argument count, although this capacity is a fundamental and indispensable condition for any human community. Everyone who proposes to come to terms with himself must reckon with this basic problem. For, to the degree that he does not admit the validity of the other person, he denies the \'other\' within himself the right to exist—and vice versa. The capacity for inner dialogue is a touchstone for outer objectivity.","source":""},{"quote":"Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its true life is invisible, hidden in the rhizome. The part that appears above ground lasts only a single summer. Then it withers away—an ephemeral apparition.

Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux. What we see is the blossom, which passes. The rhizome remains.","source":""},{"quote":"A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful. The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology.","source":""},{"quote":"It is, unfortunately, only too clear that if the individual is not truly regenerated in spirit, society cannot be either, for society is the sum total of individuals in need of redemption. I can therefore see it only as a delusion when the Churches try – as they apparently do – to rope the individual into some social organization and reduce him to a condition of diminished responsibility, instead of raising him out of the torpid, mindless mass and making clear to him that he is the one important factor and that the salvation of the world consists in the salvation of the individual soul.","source":""},{"quote":"It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one\'s personality, otherwise the repressed elements will only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive. If people can be educated to see the shadow-side of their nature clearly, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more self-knowledge can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures.","source":""},{"quote":"Everything to come was already in images: to find their soul, the ancients went into the desert. This is an image. The ancients lived their symbols, since the world had not yet become real for them. Thus they went into the solitude of the desert to teach us that the place of the soul is a lonely desert. There they found the abundance of visions, the fruits of the desert, the wondrous flowers of the soul. Think diligently about the images that the ancients have left behind. They show the way of what is to come. Look back at the collapse of empires, growth and death, of the desert and monasteries, they are the images of what is to come. Everything has been foretold. But who knows how to interpret it?","source":""},{"quote":"We no longer live on what we have, but on promises, no longer in the present day, but in the darkness of the future, which, we expect, will at last bring the proper sunrise. We refuse to recognize that everything better is purchased at the price of something worse; that, for example, the hope of grater freedom is canceled out by increased enslavement to the state, not to speak of the terrible perils to which the most brilliant discoveries of science expose us. The less we understand of what our [forebears] sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Neitzche called the spirit of gravity.","source":""},{"quote":"The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interests upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the infinite, desires and attitudes change.","source":""},{"quote":"The seed of a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particular place, in which there are a number of special factors, such as the quality of the soil and the stones, the slope of the land, and its exposure to the sun and wind. The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree\'s growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. Without the living tree, the image of the pine is only a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the realization of this uniqueness in the individual man is the goal of the process of individuation.","source":""},{"quote":"In so far as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous.","source":""},{"quote":"The real mystery does not behave mysteriously or secretively; it speaks a secret language, it adumbrates itself by a variety of images which all indicate its true nature. I am not speaking of a secret personally guarded by someone, with a content known to its possessor, but of a mystery, a matter or circumstance which is \'secret\', i.e., known only through vague hints but essentially unknown. The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery - his own psychic background -into what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.","source":""},{"quote":"The alchemist saw the union of opposites under the symbol of the tree, and it is therefore not surprising that the unconscious of present-day man, who no longer feels at home in his world and can base his existence neither on the past that is no more nor on the future that is yet to be, should hark back to the symbol of the cosmic tree rooted in this world and growing up to heaven - the tree that is also man. In the history of symbols this tree is described as the way of life itself, a growing into that which eternally is and does not change; which springs from the union of opposites and, by its eternal presence, also makes that union possible. It seems as if it were only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own \'existence\' and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.","source":""},{"quote":"The difference between the \'natural\' individuation process, which runs its course unconsciously, and the one which is consciously realized, is tremendous. In the first case consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginning. In the second case so much darkness comes to light that the personality is permeated with light, and consciousness necessarily gains in scope and insight. The encounter between conscious and unconscious has to ensure that the light which shines in the darkness is not only comprehended by the darkness, but comprehends it. The filius solis et lunae (the son of the Sun and Moon) is the possible result as well as the symbol of this union of opposites. It is the alpha and omega of the process, the mediator and intermedius. \'It has a thousand names\', say the alchemists, meaning that the source from which the individuation process rises and the goal toward which it aims is nameless, ineffable.","source":""},{"quote":"Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature...Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim. Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.","source":""},{"quote":"The fact that a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing... He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths... There are not a few who are called awake by the summons of the voice, whereupon they are at once set apart from the others, feeling themselves confronted with a problem about which the others know nothing. In most cases it is impossible to explain to the others what has happened, for any understanding is walled off by impenetrable prejudices. \'You are no different from anybody else,\' they will chorus or, \'there\'s no such thing\', and even if there is such a thing, it is immediately branded as \'morbid\'... He is at once set apart and isolated, as he has resolved to obey the law that commands him from within. \'His own law!\' everybody will cry. But he knows better: it is the law...The only meaningful life is a life that strives for the individual realization--absolute and unconditional--of its own particular law...To the extent that a man is untrue to the law of his being...he has failed to realize his own life\'s meaning. The undiscovered vein within us is a living part of the psyche; classical Chinese philosophy names this interior way \'Tao\', and likens it to a flow of water that moves irresistibly towards its goal. To rest in Tao means fulfillment, wholeness, one\'s destination reached, one\'s mission done; the beginning, end, and perfect realization of the meaning of existence innate in all things.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"C.G.

If but for an instant he could escape from the prison walls of this faith, his self consciousness would be immediately destroyed.","source":""},{"quote":"Is it not clear that with all this we are bound to feel ill at ease in an age that likes to claim the distinction of being the most humane, the mildest, and the most righteous age that the sun has ever seen? It is bad enough that precisely when we hear these beautiful words we have the ugliest suspicions. What we find in them is merely an expression — and a masquerade — of a profound weakening, of weariness, of old age, of declining energies.

He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men!","source":""},{"quote":"Everyone has his good day, when he finds his higher self; and true humanity demands that we judge someone only when he is in this condition, and not in his workdays of bondage and servitude. We should, for example, assess and honor a painter according to the highest vision he was able to see and portray. But people themselves deal very differently with this, their higher self, and often act out the role of their own self, to the extent that they later keep imitating what they were in those moments. Some regard their ideal with shy humility and would like to deny it: they fear their higher self because, when it speaks, it speaks demandingly. In addition, it has a ghostly freedom of coming or staying away as it wishes; for that reason it is often called a gift of the gods, while actually everything else is a gift of the gods (of chance): this, however, is the man himself.","source":""},{"quote":"It is not only pleasant and agreeable images that he experiences with such universal understanding: the serious, the gloomy, the sad and the profound, the sudden restraints, the mockeries of chance, fearful expectations, in short the whole \'divine comedy\' of life, the Inferno included, passes before him, not only as a shadow-play — for he too lives and suffers through these scenes — and yet also not without that fleeting sense of illusion; and perhaps many, like myself, can remember calling out to themselves in encouragement, amid the perils and terrors of the dream, and with success: \'It is a dream!

But what is it that constrains the individual to fear his neighbor, to think and act like a member of a herd, and to have no joy in himself? Modesty, perhaps, in a few rare cases. With the great majority it is indolence, inertia. … Men are even lazier than they are timid, and fear most of all the inconveniences with which unconditional honesty and nakedness would burden them.

There is no regular path which leads from these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard — of combinations of concepts.

This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is constructed as its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It seeks a new realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in myth and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors, and metonymies. It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion the world which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and eternally new as the world of dreams. Indeed, it is only by means of the rigid and regular web of concepts that the waking man clearly sees that he is awake; and it is precisely because of this that he sometimes thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of concepts is torn by art.","source":""},{"quote":"The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life must return to you, all in the same succession and sequence — even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself.

Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish the illusion of individuality, but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized.

The logic is straightforward: a despotic state can control its domestic enemies by force, but as the state loses this weapon, other devices are required to prevent the ignorant masses from interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business.","source":""},{"quote":"If we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us.

It means thinking about it, identifying parts that you want to go back to, asking how to place it in a broader context, pursuing the ideas.

Reading a book is an intellectual exercise, which stimulates thought, questions, imagination.","source":""},{"quote":"As soon as one identifies, challenges and overcomes illegitimate power, he or she is an anarchist.

Instead of communities, it produces shopping malls. The net result is an atomized society of disengaged individuals who feel demoralized and socially powerless.

It\'s also a terror-generating campaign. The common understanding at the highest level is that these actions generate potential terrorists.

He says that for every innocent person you kill, and there are plenty of them, you create ten new enemies.","source":""},{"quote":"The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general populace. It is their function to amuse, entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the values, beliefs, and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of the larger society.

When you trap people in a system of debt, they can\'t afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a \'disciplinary technique,\' and, by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the \'disciplinarian culture.\' This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.","source":""},{"quote":"In the United States, the political system is a very marginal affair. There are two parties, so-called, but they\'re really factions of the same party, the Business Party. Both represent some range of business interests. Both parties are essentially the same party. The only question is how coalitions of investors have shifted around on tactical issues now and then. As they do, the parties shift to opposite positions, within a narrow spectrum.","source":""},{"quote":"When the NSA\'s surveillance program was exposed by Edward Snowden\'s revelations, high officials claimed that it had prevented fifty-four terrorist acts. On inquiry, that was whittled down to a dozen. A high-level government panel then discovered that there was actually only one case: someone had sent $8,500 to Somalia. That was the total yield of the huge assault on the Constitution and, of course, on others throughout the world.","source":""},{"quote":"The corporatization of America during the past century has been an attack on democracy—and on markets, part of the shift from something resembling capitalism to the highly administered markets of the modern state/corporate era. A current variant is called minimizing the state, that is, transferring decision-making power from the public arena to somewhere else: to the people in the rhetoric of power; to private tyrannies, in the real world.","source":""},{"quote":"Because they don\'t teach the truth about the world, schools have to rely on beating students over the head with propaganda about democracy. If schools were, in reality, democratic, there would be no need to bombard students with platitudes about democracy. They would simply act and behave democratically, and we know this does not happen. The more there is a need to talk about the ideals of democracy, the less democratic the system usually is.","source":""},{"quote":"Obama\'s global drone assassination campaign, a remarkable innovation in global terrorism, exhibits the same patterns. By most accounts, it is generating terrorists more rapidly than it is murdering those suspected of someday intending to harm us—an impressive contribution by a constitutional lawyer on the eight hundredth anniversary of Magna Carta, which established the basis for the principle of presumption of innocence that is the foundation of civilized law.","source":""},{"quote":"Prophet just means intellectual. They were people giving geopolitical analysis, moral lessons, that sort of thing. We call them intellectuals today. There were the people we honor as prophets, there were the people we condemn as false prophets. But if you look at the biblical record, at the time, it was the other way around. The flatterers of the Court of King Ahab were the ones who were honored.

In fact it\'s training in irrational jingoism. That\'s also a feature of competitive sports.","source":""},{"quote":"Compare mathematics and the political sciences—it\'s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking.

Also, when we are dancing we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor as in a journey.

Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know. For the human organism is, apparently, the most complex of all organisms, and while one has the advantage of knowing one\'s own organism so intimately—from the inside—there is also the disadvantage of being so close to it that one can never quite get at it. Nothing so eludes conscious inspection as consciousness itself.

See, if the universe began in the past when that happened it was now; see, but it\'s still now — and the universe is still beginning now, and it\'s trailing off like the wake of a ship from now, and that wake fades out so does the past.

My body is also my total environment, and this must be measured by light-years in the billions. Hitherto the poets and philosophers of science have used the vast expanse and duration of the universe as a pretext for reflections on the unimportance of man, forgetting that man with that enchanted loom, the brain is precisely what transforms this immense electrical pulsation into light and color, shape and sound, large and small, hard and heavy, long and short.

To manifest individuality, every branch must have a sensitive connection with the tree, just as our independently moving and differentiated fingers must have a sensitive connection with the whole body. The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is that differentiation is not separation. The head and the feet are different, but not separate, and though man is not connected to the universe by exactly the same physical relation as branch to tree or feet to head, he is nonetheless connected—and by physical relations of fascinating complexity. The death of the individual is not disconnection but simply withdrawal.

What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself. So, say in Hindu mythology, they say that the world is the drama of God. God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne, that has royal perogatives. God in Indian mythology is the self, Satcitananda.

So in the same way, there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread. And you and I, sitting here in this room, as complicated human beings, are way, way out on the fringe of that bang. We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it. Very interesting. But so we define ourselves as being only that.

Countless worlds, numberless moments, an immensity of space and time.","source":""},{"quote":"Our intelligence and our technology have given us the power to affect the climate. How will we use this power? Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency in matters that affect the entire human family? Do we value short-term advantages above the welfare of the Earth? Or will we think on longer time scales, with concern for our children and our grandchildren, to understand and protect the complex life-support systems of our planet? The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished.","source":""},{"quote":"It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and perhaps our species as well. If we capitulate a superstition or greed or stupidity, we can plunge our world into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian Renaissance. But we are also capable of using our compassion and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to make an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of this planet, to enhance enormously our understanding of the universe and to carry us to the stars.","source":""},{"quote":"Humans — who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals — have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and \'animals\' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them — without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer. The behavior of other animals renders such pretensions specious. They are just too much like us.","source":""},{"quote":"What an astonishing thing a book is. It\'s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you\'re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.","source":""},{"quote":"The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. Public libraries depend on voluntary contributions. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.","source":""},{"quote":"In many cultures, the customary answer is that a God or Gods created the Universe out of nothing. But if we wish to pursue this question courageously, we must of course ask the next question: where did God come from? If we decide that this is an unanswerable question, why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the Universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God always existed, why not save a step, and conclude that the Universe always existed? That there\'s no need for a creation, it was always here. These are not easy questions. Cosmology brings us face to face with the deepest mysteries, questions that were once treated only in religion and myth.","source":""},{"quote":"Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking. This is central to its success. Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions. It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in our heads and see which ones best match the facts. It urges on us a fine balance between no-holds-barred openness to new ideas, however heretical, and the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of everything — new ideas and established wisdom. We need wide appreciation of this kind of thinking. It works. It’s an essential tool for a democracy in an age of change. Our task is not just to train more scientists but also to deepen public understanding of science.","source":""},{"quote":"Education on the value of free speech and the other freedoms reserved by the Bill of Rights, about what happens when you don\'t have them, and about how to exercise and protect them, should be an essential prerequisite for being an American citizen — or indeed a citizen of any nation, the more so to the degree that such rights remain unprotected. If we can\'t think for ourselves, if we\'re unwilling to question authority, then we\'re just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness.","source":""},{"quote":"I do not consider myself a religious person in the usual sense, but there is a religious aspect to some highs. The heightened sensitivity in all areas gives me a feeling of communion with my surroundings, both animate and inanimate. Sometimes a kind of existential perception of the absurd comes over me and I see with awful certainty the hypocrisies and posturing of myself and my fellow men. And at other times, there is a different sense of the absurd, a playful and whimsical awareness. Both of these senses of the absurd can be communicated, and some of the most rewarding highs I\'ve had have been in sharing talk and perceptions and humor. Cannabis brings us an awareness that we spend a lifetime being trained to overlook and forget and put out of our minds. A sense of what the world is really like can be maddening; cannabis has brought me some feelings for what it is like to be crazy, and how we use that word \'crazy\' to avoid thinking about things that are too painful for us. In the Soviet Union political dissidents are routinely placed in insane asylums. The same kind of thing, a little more subtle perhaps, occurs here: \'did you hear what Lenny Bruce said yesterday?

There\'s a wonderful formula that the Buddhists have for the Bodhisattva, the one whose being (sattva) is illumination (bodhi), who realizes his identity with eternity and at the same time his participation in time. And the attitude is not to withdraw from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but to realize that this horror is simply the foreground of a wonder and to come back and participate in it.

But of course the characteristic of Faust, which makes him eligible to be saved, is that he seeks aims that are not those of the machine.

But this, finally, is not easy, since some of the masks cut deep. They include judgment and moral values. They include one\'s pride, ambition, and achievement. They include one\'s infatuations. It is a common thing to be overly impressed by and attached to masks, either some mask of one\'s own or the mana-masks of others. The work of individuation, however, demands that one should not be compulsively affected in this way. The aim of individuation requires that one should find and then learn to live out of one\'s own center, in control of one\'s for and against.

We all want to escape occasionally. But science fiction is often very far from escapism, in fact you might say that science fiction is escape into reality...

The man who looks at the onrushing tidal wave, the descending avalanche, or the spinning funnel of the tornado, yet makes no attempt to flee, is not necessarily paralyzed with fright or resigned to an unavoidable fate. He may simply be unable to believe that the message of his eyes concerns him personally. It is all happening to somebody else.","source":""},{"quote":"We have a situation in which millions of vehicles, each a miracle of often unnecssary complication, are hurtling in all directions under the impulse of anything up to 200 horsepower. Many of them are the size of small houses and contain a couple of tons of sophisticated alloys — yet often carry a single passenger. They can travel at a hundred miles an hour, but are lucky if they average forty. In one lifetime they have consumed more irreplaceable fuel than has been used in the whole previous history of mankind. The roads to support them, inadequate though they are, cost as much as a small war; the analogy is a good one, for the casualties are on the same scale.","source":""},{"quote":"Communication technologies are necessary, but not sufficient, for us humans to get along with each other. This is why we still have many disputes and conflicts in the world. Technology tools help us to gather and disseminate information, but we also need qualities like tolerance and compassion to achieve greater understanding between peoples and nations. I have great faith in optimism as a guiding principle, if only because it offers us the opportunity of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I hope we\'ve learnt something from the most barbaric century in history — the 20th. I would like to see us overcome our tribal divisions and begin to think and act as if we were one family. That would be real globalisation…","source":""},{"quote":"Space can be mapped and crossed and occupied without definable limit; but it can never be conquered. When our race has reached its ultimate achievements, and the stars themselves are scattered no more widely than the seed of Adam, even then we shall still be like ants crawling on the face of the Earth. The ants have covered the world, but have they conquered it — for what do their countless colonies know of it, or of each other? So it will be with us as we spread out from Earth, loosening the bonds of kinship and understanding, hearing faint and belated rumors at second — or third — or thousandth hand of an ever dwindling fraction of the entire human race. Though the Earth will try to keep in touch with her children, in the end all the efforts of her archivists and historians will be defeated by time and distance, and the sheer bulk of material. For the numbers of distinct human societies or nations, when our race is twice its present age, may be far greater than the total number of all the men who have ever lived up to the present time. We have left the realm of comprehension in our vain effort to grasp the scale of the universe; so it must ever be, sooner rather than later.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"The Arthur C.

We have crossed a threshold into a new type of response to man\'s situation.","source":""},{"quote":"Modern man is drinking and drugging himself out of awareness, or he spends his time shopping, which is the same thing. As awarness calls for types of heroic dedication that his culture no longer provides for him, society contrives to help him forget. In the mysterious way in which life is given to us in evolution on this planet, it pushes in the direction of its own expansion. We don\'t understand it simply because we don\'t know the purpose of creation; we only feel life straining in ourselves and see it thrashing others about as they devour each other. Life seeks to expand in an unknown direction for unknown reasons.","source":""},{"quote":"Early theorists of group psychology had tried to explain why men were so sheeplike when they functioned in groups. They developed ideal like \'mental contagion\' and \'herd instinct,\' which became very popular. But as Freud was quick to see, these ideas never really did explain what men did with their judgment and common sense when they got caught up in groups. Freud saw right away what they did with it: they simply became dependent children again, blindly following the inner voice of their parents, which now came to them under the hypnotic spell of the leader. They abandoned their egos to his, identified with his power, tried to function with him as an ideal.","source":""},{"quote":"By the time the child grows up, the inverted search for a personal existence through perversity gets set in an individual mold, and it becomes more secret. It has to be secret because the community won\'t stand for the attempt by people to wholly individualize themselves. If there is going to be a victory over human incompleteness and limitation, it has to be a social project and not an individual one. Society wants to be the one to decide how people are to transcend death; it will tolerate the causa-sui project only if it fits into the standard social project. Otherwise there is the alarm of \'Anarchy!\' This is one of the reasons for bigotry and censorship of all kinds over personal morality: people fear that the standard morality will be undermined-another way of saying that they fear they will no longer be able to control life and death.","source":""},{"quote":"Kierkegaard gives us some portrait sketches of the styles of denying possibility, or the lies of character-which is the same thing. He is intent on describing what we today call \'inauthentic\' men, men who avoid developing their own uniqueness; they follow out the styles of automatic and uncritical living in which they were conditioned as children. They are \'inauthentic\' in that they do not belong to themselves, are not \'their own\' person, do not act from their own center, do not see reality on its terms; they are the one-dimensional men totally immersed in the fictional games being played in their society, unable to transcend their social conditioning: the corporation men in the West, the bureaucrats in the East, the tribal men locked up in tradition-man everywhere who doesn\'t understand what it means to think for himself and who, if he did, would shrink back at the idea of such audacity and exposure.","source":""},{"quote":"How does one transcend himself; how does he open himself to new possibility? By realizing the truth of his situation, by dispelling the lie of his character, by breaking his spirit out of its conditioned prison. The enemy, for Kierkegaard as for Freud, is the Oedipus complex. The child has built up strategies and techniques for keeping his self-esteem in the face of the terror of his situation. These techniques become an armor that hold the person prisoner. The very defenses that he needs in order to move about with self-confidence and self-esteem become his life-long trap. In order to transcend himself he must break down that which he needs in order to live. Like Lear he must throw off all his \'cultural lendings\' and stand naked in the storm of life. Kierkegaard had no illusions about man\'s urge to freedom. He knew how comfortable people were inside the prison of their character defenses. Like many prisoners they are comfortable in their limited and protected routines, and the idea of a parole into the wide world of chance, accident, and choice terrifies them.","source":""},{"quote":"The key to the creative type is that he is separated out of the common pool of shared meanings. There is something in his life experience that makes him take in the world as a problem; as a result he has to make personal sense out of it. This holds true for all creative people to a greater or lesser extent, but it is especially obvious with the artist. Existence becomes a problem that needs an ideal answer; but when you no longer accept the collective solution to the problem of existence, then you must fashion your own. The work of art is, then, the ideal answer of the creative type to the problem of existence as he takes it in-not only the existence of the external world, but especially his own: who he is as a painfully separate person with nothing shared to lean on. He has to answer to the burden of his extreme individuation, his so painful isolation. He wants to know how to earn immortality as a result of his own unique gifts. His creative work is at the same time the expression of his heroism and the justification of it. It is his \'private religion\'-as Rank put it. Its uniqueness gives him personal immortality; it is his own \'beyond\' and not that of others.","source":""},{"quote":"There is the type of man who has great contempt for \'immediacy\', who tries to cultivate his interiority, base his pride on something deeper and inner, create a distance between himself and the average man. Kierkegaard calls this type of man the \'introvert.\' He is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, with individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and withdraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret self, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, is the only real problem of life, the only worthwhile occupation preoccupation of man: What is one\'s true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In what way is one truly unique, and how can he express this uniqueness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How can the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that he feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings, and use them to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and mankind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In adolescence, most of us throb with this dilemma, expressing it either with words and thoughts or with simple numb pain and longing. But usually life suck us up into standardized activities. The social hero-system into which we are born marks out paths for our heroism, paths to which we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working our inner secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we become purely external men, playing successfully the standardized hero-game into which we happen to fall by accident, by family connection, by reflex patriotism, ro by the simple need to eat and the urge to procreate.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"Ernest Becker Foundation","link":"http://ernestbecker.org/resources/"}]},{"name":"Frank Herbert","slug":"herbert","bio":"Frank Herbert was an American science fiction writer best known for the novel \'Dune\' and its five sequels.

The forms that we see, or imagine, or perceive, or whatever it is Remote Viewers are doing, in conceptual space are mindforms made from language, and by language I also mean images, sounds.

The essential fact of our existence, perhaps the only fact of our existence – our own thought and perception is ruled off-side by the science it has invented.

Originally, all of the faucets of our culture, whether they be in the arts or sciences were the province of the Shaman. The fact that in present times, this magical power has degenerated to the level of cheap entertainment and manipulation, is, I think a tragedy. At the moment the people who are using Shamanism and magic to shape our culture are advertisers. Rather than try to wake people up, their Shamanism is used as an opiate to tranquilize people, to make people more manipulable. Their magic box of television, and by their magic words, their jingles can cause everyone in the country to be thinking the same words and have the same banal thoughts all at exactly the same moment.

In latter times I think that artists and writers have allowed themselves to be sold down the river. They have accepted the prevailing belief that art and writing are merely forms of entertainment.

They are seen as simple entertainment; things with which we can fill 20 minutes, half an hour, while we\'re waiting to die.

We better accept that we\'re just the court jesters, and all we are here to do is keep the masses happy, write some more pot-boilers, we are magicians, we are not gods. Which in fact we are. We just forget that. We forgot our searing power and lost it, as a result.

We are only us when we are here. At this particular moment in space and time, this particular locus, the overall awareness of the entire continuum happens to believe it is Alan Moore. Over there – he points to another table in the pizza restaurant – it happens to believe it is something else. I get the sense that if you can pull back from this particular locus, this web-site if you like, then you could be the whole net. All of us could be. That there is only one awareness here, that is trying out different patterns. We are going to have to come to some resolution about a lot of things in the next twenty years time, our notions of time, space, identity.","source":""},{"quote":"There is some confusion as to what magic actually is. I think this can be cleared up if you just look at the very earliest descriptions of magic. Magic in its earliest form is often referred to as “the art”. I believe this is completely literal. I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words, or images, to achieve changes in consciousness. The very language about magic seems to be talking as much about writing or art as it is about supernatural events. A grimmoir for example, the book of spells is simply a fancy way of saying grammar. Indeed, to cast a spell, is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people\'s consciousness. And I believe that this is why an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world that you are likely to see to a Shaman.","source":""},{"quote":"I don\'t want to impose my will on the universe, I\'d rather the universe imposed its will on me. I would rather that what I wanted was more in tune with what the universe wanted. So my definition of magic is a bit less invasive and intrusive. … It\'s more exploratory with me. I see magic as a vantage point from which one can look down on the rest of consciousness. It\'s a point outside normal consciousness from which you can look at normal consciousness, it\'s a point outside beliefs from which you can look at beliefs. All beliefs are reality tunnels, to use Robert Anton Wilson\'s phrase. There is the Communist reality tunnel, the Feminist reality tunnel, all of which seem to be the whole of reality when you are in the middle of them. The whole universe is based on Marxist theory if you\'re an intent Marxist. Magic is having a plan of all the tunnels, and seeing the overall condition in which they all work. Being aware of different possibilities.","source":""},{"quote":"The shaman is not a priest, the shaman has no secret knowledge, he is equivalent to the hunter. He has a specific skill that is subjugated to the needs of the group. He is prepared to take drugs, go loopy, visit the underworld, bring back knowledge and tell everybody. He\'s not keeping a secret knowledge. Originally priests were instructors, they passed out the mysteries and revelations to the masses. Increasingly, they say ‘you don\'t need to have a religious experience, we are having that for you. That\'s what we are here for. Eventually, they start saying ‘you don\'t need to have a religious experience, and neither do we. We\'ve got this book about some people who – a thousand years ago – had a religious experience. And if you come in on Sunday, we\'ll read you a bit of that and you\'ll be sorted, don\'t you worry. Effectively a portcullis has slammed down between the individual and their godhead. ‘You can\'t approach your godhead except through us now. We are the only path. Our church is the only path.\' But that is every human being\'s birthright, to have ingress to their godhead.","source":""},{"quote":"In our every cell, furled at the nucleus, there is a ribbon two yards long and just ten atoms wide. Over a hundred million miles of DNA in very human individual, enough to wrap five million times around our world and make the Midgard serpent blush for shame, make even the Ourobouros worm swallow hard in disbelief. This snake-god, nucleotide, twice twisted, scaled in adenine and cytosine, in thymine and in guanine, is a one-man show, will be the actors, props and setting, be the apple and the garden both. The player bides his time, awaits his entrance to a drum-roll of igniting binaries. This is the only dance in town, this anaconda tango, this slow spiral up through time from witless dirt to paramecium, from blind mechanic organism to awareness. There, below the birthing stars, Life sways and improvises. Every poignant gesture drips with slapstick; pathos; an unbearably affecting bravery. To dare this stage, this huge and overwhelming venue. Squinting through the stellar footlights, hoping there\'s an audience, that there\'s someone out there, but dancing anyway. But dancing anyway.","source":""},{"quote":"To me, when we talk about the world, we are talking about our ideas of the world. Our ideas of organisation, our different religions, our different economic systems, our ideas about it are the world. We are heading for a radical revision where you could say we are heading towards the end of the world, but more in the R.E.M. sense than the Revelation sense. That is what apocalypse means – revelation. I could square that with the end of the world, a revelation, a new way of looking at things, something that completely radicalises our notions of the where we were, when we were, what we were, something like that would constitute an end to the world in the kind of abstract – yet very real sense – that I am talking about. A change in the language, a change in the thinking, a change in the music. It wouldn\'t take much – one big scientific idea, or artistic idea, one good book, one good painting – who knows – we are at a critical point where the ideas are coming thicker and faster and stranger and stranger than they ever were before. They are realised at a greater speed, everything has become very fluid.","source":""},{"quote":"Live knowing that you are already dust, long gone, already outside time and looking in, reviewing life, finally understanding every déja vu, your own guardian angel. Know that the scorched-black demons and the pristine, fluttering seraphs are in some sense naught but you yourself unpacked, unfolded in a higher space from whence the myriad gods unfurl, not bygone legends but your once and future selves, your attributes blossomed into their purest and most potent symbol-forms. And these, with all their beast-heats, crowns and lightings, all their different colors, are become combined into the single whiteness that is godhead; that is all. This, then, is revelation. All is one, and all is deity, this beautiful undying fire of being that is everywhere about us; that we are. O man, o woman, know yourself, and know you are divine. Respect yourself, respect the least phenomenon of your existence as it were the breath of God. Know that our universe is all one place, a single firelit room, all time a single moment. Know that there has only ever been one person here. Know you are everything, forever. Know I love you.","source":""},{"quote":"Most people find the word Apocalypse to be a terrifying concept. Checked in the dictionary, it means only revelation, although it obviously has also come to mean end of the world. As to what the end of the world means, I would say that probably depends on what we mean by world. I don\'t think this means the planet, or even the life forms upon the planet. I think the world is purely a construction of ideas, and not just the physical structures, but the mental structures, the ideologies that we\'ve erected, that is what I would call the world. Our political structures, philosophical structures, ideological frameworks, economies. These are actually imaginary things, and yet that is the framework that we have built our entire world upon. It strikes me that a strong enough wave of information could completely overturn and destroy all of that. A sudden realization that would change our entire perspective upon who we are and how we exist. History is a heat, it is the heat of accumulated information and accumulated complexity. As our culture progresses, we find that we gather more and more information and that we slowly start to move almost from a fluid to a vaporous state, as we approach the ultimate complexity of a social boiling point. I believe that our culture is turning to steam.","source":""},{"quote":"Much of magic as I understand it in the Western occult tradition is the search for the Self, with a capital S. This is understood as being the Great Work, as being the gold the alchemists sought, as being the Will, the Soul, the thing we have inside us that is behind the intellect, the body, the dreams. The inner dynamo of us, if you like. Now this is the single most important thing that we can ever attain, the knowledge of our own Self. And yet there are a frightening amount of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the Self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. This is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness, because it\'s too much of a responsibility to actually posses such a thing as a soul, such a precious thing. What if you break it? What if you lose it? Mightn\'t it be best to anesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure? I think that the way that people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up, can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher Self and then having to maintain it.","source":""},{"quote":"As I understand the theory of period information doubling, this states that if we take one period of human information as being the time between the invention of the first hand axe, say around 50,000 BC and 1 AD, then this is one period of human information and we can measure it by how many human inventions we came up during that time. Then we see how long it takes for us to have twice as many inventions. This means that human information has doubled. As it turns out, after the first 50,000-year period, the second period is about 1500 years, say around the time of the Renaissance. By then we have twice as much information. To double again, human information took a couple of hundred years. The period speeds up—between 1960 and 1970, human information doubled. At the last count human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to this, there is a point sometime around 2015 where human information is doubling every thousandth of a second. This means that in each thousandth of a second we will have accumulated more information than we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge. I believe that our culture would probably move into a completely different state, would move past the boiling point, from a fluid culture to a culture of steam.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"Alan Moore on Art & Magic","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1qACd0wHd0"},{"title":"The Mindscape of Alan Moore","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFHn-HzacxY"},{"title":"Alan Moore - Topic - YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTu8luL3vzUnoFCUa7rNh1g/playlists"}]},{"name":"Philip K.

Gurdjieff","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff","quote":"From my point of view, he can be called a remarkable man who stands out from those around him by the resourcefulness of his mind, and who knows how to be restrained in the manifestations which proceed from his nature, at the same time conducting himself justly and tolerantly towards the weaknesses of others."},{"name":"Mark Twain","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain","quote":"In religion and politics people\'s beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing."},{"name":"Robert A. Heinlein","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein","quote":"One can judge from experiment, or one can blindly accept authority. To the scientific mind, experimental proof is all important and theory is merely a convenience in description to be junked when it no longer fits. To the academic mind, authority is everything and facts are junked when they do not fit theory laid down by authority."},{"name":"Albert Camus","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus","quote":"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience. They leave to their intellectuals on duty the chore of believing in them and of proving that religion, patriotism, and justice need for their survival the sacrifice of freedom."},{"name":"George Orwell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Orwell","quote":"Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them, and there is almost no kind of outrage — torture, the use of hostages, forced labour, mass deportations, imprisonment without trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of civilians — which does not change its moral colour when it is committed by \'our\' side."},{"name":"Henry David Thoreau","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau","quote":"I heartily accept the motto, \'That government is best which governs least\'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe — \'That government is best which governs not at all\'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."},{"name":"Robert A. Heinlein","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein","quote":"The hardest part about gaining any new idea is sweeping out the false idea occupying that niche. As long as that niche is occupied, evidence and proof and logical demonstration get nowhere. But once the niche is emptied of the wrong idea that has been filling it — once you can honestly say, \'I don\'t know\', then it becomes possible to get at the truth."},{"name":"Ken Wilber","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber","quote":"The real problem is not exterior. The real problem is interior. The real problem is how to get people to internally transform, from egocentric to sociocentric to worldcentric consciousness, which is the only stance that can grasp the global dimensions of the problem in the first place, and thus the only stance that can freely, even eagerly, embrace global solutions."},{"name":"Arthur Conan Doyle","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle","quote":"The more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been accumulated since the dawning of time. ... Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain footsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal."},{"name":"Ray Bradbury","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury","quote":"The problem in our country isn\'t with books being banned, but with people no longer reading. Look at the magazines, the newspapers around us – it\'s all junk, all trash, tidbits of news. The average TV ad has 120 images a minute. Everything just falls off your mind. … You don\'t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them."},{"name":"Michael Faraday","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday","quote":"Among those points of self-education which take up the form of mental discipline, there is one of great importance, and, moreover, difficult to deal with, because it involves an internal conflict, and equally touches our vanity and our ease. It consists in the tendency to deceive ourselves regarding all we wish for, and the necessity of resistance to these desires."},{"name":"Gustave Le Bon","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Le_Bon","quote":"The masses have never thirsted after truth. They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them. Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim. An individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will."},{"name":"Stephen Hawking","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking","quote":"If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality."},{"name":"Henry David Thoreau","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau","quote":"Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."},{"name":"Ray Bradbury","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury","quote":"I often use the metaphor of Perseus and the head of Medusa when I speak of science fiction. Instead of looking into the face of truth, you look over your shoulder into the bronze surface of a reflecting shield. Then you reach back with your sword and cut off the head of Medusa. Science fiction pretends to look into the future but it\'s really looking at a reflection of what is already in front of us."},{"name":"Clarence Darrow","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Darrow","quote":"An agnostic is a doubter. The word is generally applied to those who doubt the verity of accepted religious creeds of faiths. Everyone is an agnostic as to the beliefs or creeds they do not accept. Any one who thinks is an agnostic about something, otherwise he must believe that he is possessed of all knowledge. And the proper place for such a person is in the madhouse or the home for the feeble-minded."},{"name":"George Orwell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Orwell","quote":"This business of making people conscious of what is happening outside their own small circle is one of the major problems of our time, and a new literary technique will have to be evolved to meet it. ... As time goes on and the horrors pile up, the mind seems to secrete a sort of self-protecting ignorance which needs a harder and harder shock to pierce it, just as the body will become immunised to a drug and require bigger and bigger doses."},{"name":"Jacques Vallée","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e","quote":"The web is becoming the medium of choice for disinformation and misinformation, including official efforts to inject new \'memes\' into the culture. Although I remain an optimist about the web as a medium for free exchanges of data and faster communication of high value and faster communication of high value, it is also a potential tool for propaganda, false rumors intentionally planted and for a range of techniques designed to alter or filter social reality."},{"name":"Socrates","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Socrates","quote":"The inexperienced in wisdom and virtue, ever occupied with feasting and such, are carried downward, and there, as is fitting, they wander their whole life long, neither ever looking upward to the truth above them nor rising toward it, nor tasting pure and lasting pleasures. Like cattle, always looking downward with their heads bent toward the ground and the banquet tables, they feed, fatten, and fornicate. In order to increase their possessions they kick and butt with horns and hoofs of steel and kill each other, insatiable as they are."},{"name":"Dwight Eisenhower","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower","quote":"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together."},{"name":"Ray Bradbury","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury","quote":"I foresaw political correctness 43 years ago. … whereas back then I wrote about the tyranny of the majority, today I\'d combine that with the tyranny of the minorities. These days, you have to be careful of both. They both want to control you. … I say to both bunches, Whether you\'re a majority or minority, bug off! To hell with anybody who wants to tell me what to write. Their society breaks down into subsections of minorities who then, in effect, burn books by banning them. All this political correctness that\'s rampant on campuses is B.S. You can\'t fool around with the dangerous notion of telling a university what to teach and what not to."},{"name":"Dwight Eisenhower","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower","quote":"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people... This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."}]}]')},195:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var
