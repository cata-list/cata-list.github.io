Taking place over 2017 and 2018, their project entailed submitting bogus academic papers to academic journals in cultural, queer, race, gender, fat, and sexuality studies to determine if they would pass through peer review and be accepted for publication. Several of these papers were subsequently published, which the authors cited in support of their contention. Prior to the affair, various academics had expressed concerns about the intellectual validity of much postmodern and critical theory-influenced research and highlighted this by publishing hoax articles in various journals. The hoax received a mixed reception within academia. Some academics praised it for exposing flaws that they believed to be widespread among sectors of the humanities and social sciences influenced by postmodernism, critical theory, and identity politics.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Thumbnail_of_video_Academics_expose_corruption_in_Grievance_Studies.jpg","logo":""},{"title":"How to Trick Your Brain to Remember Almost Anything","source":"Wired","author":"Matt Reynolds","date":"Jul 12, 2020","id":"Tp2iOUbRIRn_MYYC0lh8K","data_updated":"Sunday, July 12, 2020 11:20 AM","description":"Four-time USA Memory Champion Nelson Dellis and psychological scientist Julia Shaw explain how to boost your memory skills.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-trick-your-brain-to-remember-almost-anything/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f08e0ce1858dc99635e027b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_memory-BB8152-001.jpg","logo":"https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ccc13c90b928e0b02eaafcfb05864c93a0136dd0.ico"},{"title":"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate","source":"Harper\'s Magazine","author":"","date":"Jul 7, 2020","id":"WSa9KD9j_xOGvG56WzAhR","data_updated":"Wednesday, July 8, 2020 1:43 PM","description":"The below letter will be appearing in the Letters section of the magazine\'s October issue.

Research has recently shown that beaked and blue whales are sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar and move rapidly away from the source of the sonar, a response that disrupts their feeding and can cause mass strandings.  Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation or \'biosonar\' systems to locate predators and prey. It is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating. The study has shown whales experience decompression sickness, a disease that forces nitrogen into gas bubbles in the tissues and is caused by rapid and prolonged surfacing. Although whales were originally thought to be immune to this disease, sonar has been implicated in causing behavioral changes that can lead to decompression sickness."},{"title":"Hundreds of Elephants Have Mysteriously Died in Botswana","source":"Gizmodo","author":"George Dvorsky","date":"Jul 3, 2020","id":"dAzAPn2mEyhrNY07HGRNP","data_updated":"Friday, July 3, 2020 12:33 PM","description":"Over 350 elephants have died in Botswana since March, sparking a government probe to investigate the mysterious deaths.","link":"https://earther.gizmodo.com/hundreds-of-elephants-have-mysteriously-died-in-botswan-1844259228","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/kumlibneeofgc3xkxw50.jpg","logo":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/eir2ldhuj6n1thhxrcpq.png"},{"title":"The Secretive Government Agency Planting \'Cyanide Bombs\' Across the US","source":"The Guardian","author":"Jimmy Tobias","date":"Jun 26, 2020","id":"y4K_trLKfLKKA7LZcJ-OU","data_updated":"Tuesday, June 30, 2020 2:02 PM","description":"Wildlife Services kills thousands of animals at ranchers and farmers\' behest.

According to the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons official statement, \'He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff.\' The New York City medical examiner ruled Epstein\'s death a suicide. Epstein\'s lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation. Epstein\'s brother Mark hired Michael Baden to oversee the autopsy. In late October, Baden announced that autopsy evidence was more indicative of homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. Both the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice\'s inspector general are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with conspiracy and record falsification. Due to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of his death (e.g. the removal of his cellmate without a replacement, the falling asleep of two guards who were meant to check on him, and the malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell) and Epstein\'s claimed knowledge of compromising information about famous people, his death generated doubt about his apparent suicide and speculation that he was murdered."},{"title":"Overseas Censorship of Chinese Issues","source":"Wikipedia","author":"","description":"","smmry":0,"link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_censorship_of_Chinese_issues","date":"","wikiextract":"Overseas censorship of Chinese issues refers to censorship outside the People\'s Republic of China of topics considered sensitive by the ruling Communist Party of China.
