In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson\'s wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters.

Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.Frankenstein, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature?

But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe\'s great work, the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a rejuvenated life and winning the love of the beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire, and self-delusion, Faust heads inexorably toward an infernal destruction.","image":"books/Faust_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Faust"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust"},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":"https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/f/faust-parts-1-and-2/about-faust-parts-1-and-2"},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":"https://www.litcharts.com/lit/faust"},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Faust_(Goethe)"},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406373.Faust"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"I, Robot","author":"Isaac Asimov","year":"1950","goodreadsRating":"4.18","ratingNew":4.2,"numRatings":261327,"numPages":224,"published":"1950","isbn":9780553803709,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388321463i/41804._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"The three laws of Robotics:1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender\'s two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military\'s purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine\'s abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com","categories":["Science Fiction","Fiction","Young Adult","Fantasy","Classics","Science Fiction Fantasy","Dystopia","War","Audiobook","Adventure"],"plot":"A 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card.

The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.","image":"books/Catch-22_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Catch22"},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":"https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/c/catch22/book-summary"},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/"},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168668.Catch_22"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"Macbeth","author":"William Shakespeare","year":"1606","goodreadsRating":"3.9","ratingNew":3.9,"numRatings":640870,"numPages":249,"published":"1606","isbn":9780743477109,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795224i/8852._SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland.

The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall.

Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade.

Yet we also witness the astounding moral courage of the incorruptible, who, defenseless, endured great brutality and degradation.","image":"books/Gulag Archipelago_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Gulag_Archipelago"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGulagArchipelago"},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956"},{"title":"File","link":"https://archive.org/details/TheGulagArchipelago-Threevolumes"}]},{"title":"The Republic","author":"Plato","year":"-380","goodreadsRating":"3.91","ratingNew":3.94,"numRatings":157607,"numPages":416,"published":"-380","isbn":9780140449143,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655i/30289._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it.

Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term? 1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure. 9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice 10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force.

Machiavelli wrote The Prince to demonstrate his skill in the art of the state, presenting advice on how a prince might acquire and hold power.

Rather a person\'s identity (their ego) binds them to the physical universe, creating a relationship with their environment and other people. The separation of the self and the physical world leads to the misuse of technology and the attempt to violently subjugate man\'s natural environment, leading to its destruction.Explaining man\'s role in the universe as a unique expression of the total universe, and interdependent on it, Alan Watts offers a new understanding of personal identity. It reveals the mystery of existence, presenting and alternative to the feelings of alienation that is prevalent in Western society, and a vision of how we can come to understand the cosmic self that is within every living thing.","categories":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Spirituality","Psychology","Religion"],"plot":"At the root of human conflict is our fundamental misunderstanding of who we are. The illusion that we are isolated beings, unconnected to the rest of the universe, has led us to view the \'outside\' world with hostility, and has fueled our misuse of technology and our violent and hostile subjugation of the natural world. In The Book, philosopher Alan Watts provides us with a much-needed answer to the problem of personal identity, distilling and adapting the ancient Hindu philosophy of Vedanta to help us understand that the self is in fact the root and ground of the universe. In this mind-opening and revelatory work, Watts has crafted a primer on what it means to be human—and a manual of initiation into the central mystery of existence.","image":"books/The Book_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alan_Watts"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60551.The_Book_on_the_Taboo_Against_Knowing_Who_You_Are"},{"title":"File","link":"https://terebess.hu/english/AlanWatts-On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf"}]},{"title":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","year":"1883-1891","goodreadsRating":"4.05","ratingNew":4.06,"numRatings":101929,"numPages":327,"published":"1883","isbn":null,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480901846i/51893._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a foundational work of Western literature and is widely considered to be Friedrich Nietzsche’s masterpiece.

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps.

By 1990, those figures had reversed.” As we know, speculation continued to increase exponentially.

Crime goes down. The prison population doubles.\\"\\"Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world\'s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail.\\"  In search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends--growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration--come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime--but it\'s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side.  In \\"The Divide, \\"Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice--the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights.  Through astonishing--and enraging--accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide\'s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all.

He describes further how Blackwater (at the time of writing) serves in Iraq and Afghanistan like, in his judgement, a Praetorian Guard, protecting top authority figures and enjoying immunity from the usual constraints and regulations on traditional armies.

The stunning rise, fall, and rescue of Wall Street in the bubble-and-bailout era was the coming-out party for the network of looters who sit at the nexus of American political and economic power. The grifter class—made up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their bidding—has been growing in power for a generation, transferring wealth upward through increasingly complex financial mechanisms and political maneuvers. The crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how they’ve hijacked America’s political and economic life.Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi here unravels the whole fiendish story, digging beyond the headlines to get into the deeper roots and wider implications of the rise of the grifters. He traces the movement’s origins to the cult of Ayn Rand and her most influential—and possibly weirdest—acolyte, Alan Greenspan, and offers fresh reporting on the backroom deals that decided the winners and losers in the government bailouts. He uncovers the hidden commodities bubble that transferred billions of dollars to Wall Street while creating food shortages around the world, and he shows how finance dominates politics, from the story of investment bankers auctioning off America’s infrastructure to an inside account of the high-stakes battle for health-care reform—a battle the true reformers lost. Finally, he tells the story of Goldman Sachs, the “vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.”  Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing, and scathingly funny account yet written of the ongoing political and financial crisis in America. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the labyrinthine inner workings of politics and finance in this country, and the profound consequences for us all.","categories":["Nonfiction","Economics","Politics","Business","History","Finance"],"plot":"A book about the events that led to the financial crisis of 2008.

Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications. These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media’s handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.","categories":["Politics","Nonfiction","History","Philosophy","Sociology","Economics","Journalism","Political Science","Society","Psychology"],"plot":"In this pathbreaking work Edward S.

What are the ten principles of concentration of wealth and power at work in America today? They\'re simple enough: reduce democracy, shape ideology, redesign the economy, shift the burden onto the poor and middle classes, attack the solidarity of the people, let special interests run the regulators, engineer election results, use fear and the power of the state to keep the rabble in line, manufacture consent, marginalize the population. In Requiem for the American Dream, Chomsky devotes a chapter to each of these ten principles, and adds readings from some of the core texts that have influenced his thinking to bolster his argument.To create Requiem for the American Dream, Chomsky and his editors, the filmmakers Peter Hutchison, Kelly Nyks, and Jared P. Scott, spent countless hours together over the course of five years, from 2011 to 2016. After the release of the film version, Chomsky and the editors returned to the many hours of tape and transcript and created a document that included three times as much text as was used in the film. The book that has resulted is nonetheless arguably the most succinct and tightly woven of Chomsky\'s long career, a beautiful vessel--including old-fashioned ligatures in the typeface--in which to carry Chomsky\'s bold and uncompromising vision, his perspective on the economic reality and its impact on our political and moral well-being as a nation.\\"During the Great Depression, which I\'m old enough to remember, it was bad–much worse subjectively than today.

What are the ten principles of concentration of wealth and power at work in America today? They\'re simple enough: reduce democracy, shape ideology, redesign the economy, shift the burden onto the poor and middle classes, attack the solidarity of the people, let special interests run the regulators, engineer election results, use fear and the power of the state to keep the rabble in line, manufacture consent, marginalize the population. In Requiem for the American Dream, Chomsky devotes a chapter to each of these ten principles, and adds readings from some of the core texts that have influenced his thinking to bolster his argument.","image":"books/Requiem for the American Dream_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Noam_Chomsky"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":"https://books.google.com/books?id=i8TqDAAAQBAJ"},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30629273-requiem-for-the-american-dream"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"Weapons of Mass Instruction: A Schoolteacher\'s Journey Through The Dark World of Compulsory Schooling","author":"John Taylor Gatto","year":"2008","goodreadsRating":"4.21","ratingNew":4.23,"numRatings":1746,"numPagesActual":192,"publishedActual":"October 1st 2008","isbn":9780865716315,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328776697i/3429724._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"“Gatto draws on thirty years in the classroom and many years of research as a school reformer. He puts forth his thesis with a rhetorical style that is passionate, logical, and laden with examples and illustrations.” ForeWord Magazine“Weapons of Mass Instruction is probably his best yet. Gatto’s storytelling skill shines as he relates tales of real people who fled the school system and succeeded in spite of the popular wisdom that insists on diplomas, degrees and credentials. If you are just beginning to suspect there may be a problem with schooling (as opposed to educating as Gatto would say), then you’ll not likely find a better expose of the problem than Weapons of Mass Instruction.” Cathy Duffy Reviews\\"In this book, the noisy gadfly of U.S. education takes up the question of damage done in the name of schooling. Again he touches on many of the same questions and finds the same answers.  Gatto is a bold and compelling critic in a field defined by politic statements, and from the first pages of this book he takes even unwilling readers along with him. In Weapons of Mass Instruction, he speaks movingly to readers\' deepest desires for an education that taps their talents and frees frustrated ambitions. It is a challenging and extraordinary book that is a must read for anyone navigating their way through the school system.\\" - Ria Julien - Winnipeg Free PressJohn Taylor Gatto’s Weapons of Mass Instruction focuses on mechanisms of familiar schooling that cripple imagination, discourage critical thinking, and create a false view of learning as a by-product of rote-memorization drills. Gatto’s earlier book, Dumbing Us Down, put that now-famous expression of the title into common use worldwide. Weapons of Mass Instruction promises to add another chilling metaphor to the brief against schooling.Here is a demonstration that the harm school inflicts is quite rational and deliberate, following high-level political theories constructed by Plato, Calvin, Spinoza, Fichte, Darwin, Wundt, and others, which contend the term “education” is meaningless because humanity is strictly limited by necessities of biology, psychology, and theology. The real function of pedagogy is to render the common population manageable.Realizing that goal demands that the young be conditioned to rely upon experts, remain divided from natural alliances, and accept disconnections from the experiences that create self-reliance and independence.Escaping this trap requires a different way of growing up, one Gatto calls “open source learning.” In chapters such as “A Letter to Kristina, my Granddaughter”; “Fat Stanley”; and “Walkabout:London,” this different reality is illustrated.John Taylor Gatto taught for thirty years in public schools before resigning from school-teaching in the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal during the year he was named New York State’s official Teacher of the Year. Since then, he has traveled three million miles lecturing on school reform.","categories":["Education","Nonfiction","Politics","History","Teaching","Sociology","Parenting","Philosophy","Psychology","School"],"plot":"Focuses on mechanisms of familiar schooling that cripple imagination, discourage critical thinking, and create a false view of learning as a by-product of rote-memorization drills.

These three Great Untruths are part of a larger philosophy that sees young people as fragile creatures who must be protected and supervised by adults. But despite the good intentions of the adults who impart them, the Great Untruths are harming kids by teaching them the opposite of ancient wisdom and the opposite of modern psychological findings on grit, growth, and antifragility. The result is rising rates of depression and anxiety, along with endless stories of college campuses torn apart by moralistic divisions and mutual recriminations. This is a book about how we got here. First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt take us on a tour of the social trends stretching back to the 1980s that have produced the confusion and conflict on campus today, including the loss of unsupervised play time and the birth of social media, all during a time of rising political polarization.  This is a book about how to fix the mess. The culture of “safety” and its intolerance of opposing viewpoints has left many young people anxious and unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for their parents, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for a democracy that is already pushed to the brink of violence over its growing political divisions. Lukianoff and Haidt offer a comprehensive set of reforms that will strengthen young people and institutions, allowing us all to reap the benefits of diversity, including viewpoint diversity.

Hume\'s Abstract of the Treatise, also included in the volume, outlines his \'chief argument\' regarding our conception of, and belief in, cause and effect. The texts printed in this volume are those of the critical edition of Hume\'s philosophical works now being published by the Clarendon Press.

Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts. The Critique brings together the two opposing schools of philosophy: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience.

Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.\\n\\nAnd after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled.\\nThis led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.\\nBut the big picture conceals  the details.\\n\\nLet us look at one region in particular:\\nSub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.\\nWhile some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100.\\nSuch growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.\\nSo is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?\\n\\nSupport us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=h\\n\\nSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagt\\nMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org\\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxz\\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5O\\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83\\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdv\\n\\nThe Voice of Kurzgesagt:\\nSteve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/\\n\\nThe music of the video here:\\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/2Pgk5mD\\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/2Ebipoa\\nYoutube: https://bit.ly/34h7YKl\\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4\\n\\nTHANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:\\nPatrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet","keywords":["Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa","Overpopulation","Population","World Population","human","mankind","fertility","poverty","education","contraception","contraceptives","birth rates","Asia","Bangladesh","income","child mortality","economy","South Korea","India","Thailand","Philippines","culture Ethiopia","health","Botswana","Sierra Leone","Subsaharan Africa"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMo3nZHVrZ4"},{"title":"An Antidote to Dissatisfaction","image":"yt/WPPPFqsECz0_sm.jpg","date":"Dec 07 2019","full_title":"An Antidote to Dissatisfaction","views":6154546,"likes":432773,"dislikes":4729,"rating":4.9567637,"length_seconds":601,"published":1575763200000,"description":"2nd edition of our gratitude journal is now available for pre-order: https://shop.kurzgesagt.org/\\nWORLDWIDE SHIPPING IS AVAILABLE!\\n\\nWe want to get you the best shipping fees.

Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we\'re mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn\'t get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.\\n\\nTurn on the captions.

Weinstein\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\nMay 22, 2018\\n\\nTomorrow is the one year anniversary of the day that 50 Evergreen students--students that I had never met--disrupted my class, accusing me of racism and demanding my resignation. I tried to reason with them. I felt no fear because I knew that, whatever my failings might be, bigotry was not among them.\\n\\nAt that moment. I felt sure I could reach these students. I also felt a moral obligation to try. Racism, which squanders human potential, and erodes human dignity, offends me. I am also well versed in the evolutionary logic that makes racism durable. I should have had no trouble establishing common ground.\\n\\nTheir response surprised me, and it would take months for me to fully understand what had happened. The protestors had no apparent interest in the very dialog they seemed to invite. I was even more surprised by the protestor\'s fervor in shouting down my actual students--some of whom had known me for years. The cruelty and derision reserved for students of color who spoke in my defense was particularly chilling.\\n\\nIf not discussion, what did they want? I was one of Evergreen\'s most popular professors. I had Evergreen\'s version of tenure. Did they really think they could force my resignation based on a meritless accusation?\\n\\nThey did think that. And they were right. What I had not counted on was their alliance with Evergreen\'s new president.\\n\\nThough the protestors openly humiliated him, the president of the college partnered with the mob in private, handing them concession after concession. We know this because the rioters filmed everything and proudly uploaded it. In one particularly telling video, President Bridges calmly discusses with the leaders of the protest a demand to target STEM faculty based on the empty assertion that scientists are particularly prone to bias. In that same video the president speaks of his plan for those who resist the new order: \\"Bring \'em in. Train \'em. And if they don\'t get it, sanction \'em.\\" He invites his partners to hold him to it.\\n\\nOn the second day of unrest, the police chief called me. Rioters were stopping traffic and searching for someone, car to car. The chief believed it was me. She was worried for my safety and helpless to protect me as the president had ordered her force to \\"stand down.\\" What would have transpired if the rioters had found me? I still don\'t know, and I strongly suspect they don\'t either.\\n\\nThe protest at my class did not emerge out of the blue in May, 2017. One year earlier I stood up and spoke in opposition to a dangerous proposal, one that threatened to establish a racial hierarchy amongst faculty.\\n\\nTo those who have not faced something similar, this likely sounds hyperbolic. But one can now advance such policies, and almost certainly succeed in passing them, if they are properly draped in weaponized terminology. \\"Equity\\", for example, has taken on special properties. If a person opposes an \\"equity\\" proposal, those advancing the proposal are secure in asserting that their opponent is motivated by opposition to racial equity itself: In other words, that they are racist.\\n\\nMy opposition to that first \\"equity\\" proposal was voiced to my colleagues, with no students present. Demands for my resignation one year later, were not the result of organic student confusion. They were payback for violating a de facto code of faculty conduct in which one\'s right to speak is now dictated by adherence to an ascendant orthodoxy in which one\'s race, gender and sexual orientation are paramount. The students were on a mission. They were unwitting tools of a witting movement.\\n\\nThis committee should take my tale as cautionary. Is there a free speech crisis on college campuses? One can certainly make that argument, but that portrayal is at least as misleading as it is informative. What is occurring on college campuses is about power and control--speech is impeded as a last resort, used when people fail to self-censor in response to a threat of crippling stigma and the destruction of their capacity to earn.\\n\\nFull Hearing:\\nhttps://oversight.house.gov/hearing/c...","keywords":["Free Speech","College","Campus","Oversight Committee","Testimony","Bret","Weinstein","Evergreen","Safe Spaces","Protest","Equity","Riot","Congress","Senate","Committee","George Bridges","Student","Activists","Antifa","Eric","Biology","Race","Gender","Sex","political correctness","university","oppression","social justice","sjw","adam carolla","Washington","Olympia","Ben Shapiro","Adam Carolla","Michael Zimmerman"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRIKJCKWla4"},{"title":"The Path to an Excellent World","image":"yt/CLHdY5Cyf58_sm.jpg","date":"Mar 28 2018","full_title":"The Path to an Excellent World","views":48265,"likes":1668,"dislikes":45,"rating":4.8949213,"length_seconds":2185,"published":1522281600000,"description":"If humanity is to survive, we will need to change the way civilization functions, rendering our system stably abundant.

Stem cell biologist, bestselling author of The Biology of Belief and recipient of the 2009 Goi Peace Award, he has been a guest speaker on hundreds of TV and radio shows, as well as keynote presenter for national and international conferences.\\n\\nIn 1982, Dr. Lipton began examining the principles of quantum physics and how they might be integrated into his understanding of the cell’s information processing systems. He produced breakthrough studies on the cell membrane, which revealed that this outer layer of the cell was an organic homologue of a computer chip, the cell’s equivalent of a brain. His research at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, between 1987 and 1992, revealed that the environment, operating though the membrane, controlled the behavior and physiology of the cell, turning genes on and off. His discoveries, which ran counter to the established scientific view that life is controlled by the genes, presaged one of today’s most important fields of study, the science of epigenetics. Two major scientific publications derived from these studies defined the molecular pathways connecting the mind and body.

As a result of the nature of spacetime, a clock that is moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer\'s own frame of reference. A clock that is under the influence of a stronger gravitational field than an observer\'s will also be measured to tick slower than the observer\'s own clock.\\n\\nSuch time dilation has been repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities in a pair of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by clocks on the Space Shuttle running slightly slower than reference clocks on Earth, or clocks on GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel.\\nCorrection: Einstein published the his theory of Special Relativity in 1905, not 1919.

They make learning fun and easy.\\n\\nIf you\'re interesting in hiring us to create an animation for your company, please visit https://www.afterskool.net/services/ for details!\\n\\nMagnum opus is a latin term that is defined as someone’s greatest life achievement. It is the highest intersection of talent, skill and hard work, when someone reaches their maximum potential at the exact right time in the exact right place.\\nEveryone has a massive amount of potential, whether it be an invention, a painting, a song, a journey, a book, an idea, you name it, but very few actually get to flourish and reach for that potential. When you’re a young child, you hold the belief that anything is possible, no dream is too big...so what happens between childhood and adulthood that crushes so many dreams? Why do so many settle? Is it the school system? Is it “realistic” expectations? Financial fear? Practicality? A lack of belief?\\n\\nThe reason people don’t attempt their magnum opus is because of doubt. Doubt is the ultimate crippler of ambition. In order to believe in yourself, you must have evidence to support this belief. It’s like a table. Your belief is the table-top and the legs are experiences and evidence that support the belief. Doubt is like a woodpecker, that chips away at the legs of the table. When enough doubt creeps into your mind, the table comes crashing down and you no longer believe in yourself. The key is to reverse this process. Move toward beliefs that empower you, then find role models, experiences, stories and evidence to support the new empowering belief. Most importantly, do not listen to the doubters. Doubters are cynical people who have never attempted what you’re setting out to do. Buddha said, “we are what we think, all that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.” Achieving your goal starts with the mental belief that it can be done. Attitude is far more important than IQ.\\n\\nIt may seem scary and unfamiliar, for the path to your magnum opus is never easy. You will have to be willing to take risks, sacrifice, and to go the extra mile. At the end of this short life, you want to look back and say, i gave it my all. I took a shot, and left it all on the line.\\n\\nThis simple exercise can help you focus your energy and home in on your magnum opus journey. Write down things you love to do, things you’re good at and things people will pay you to do. The intersection of these 3 categories is your “sweet spot”. Perhaps you can combine things from all 3 categories. The key to reaching your magnum opus is to find your sweet spot and take action.\\n\\nFor more interesting animations, please subscribe!

A backlash against the hippy counterculture – “the war on drugs” – halted research into psychedelics. In 1971, the UK parliament introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act, classifying psilocybin, LSD and DMT as illegal class A drugs. All further research on psychedelics was banned.\\n\\nThe definition of a schedule 1 drug, which the most illegal classification, is a substance that has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Since the 1970’s there has been strong advocacy to take cannabis off the schedule 1 list. Cannabis has been found to improve many health issues, such as seizures, sleep disorders and arthritis. Although cannabis still remains on the schedule 1 list today, The evidence is so strong in favor of medicinal marijuana that it has become legalized in over half the U.S states and many countries around the world.\\n\\nThe legalization of cannabis has opened the door to re-examine the possible medical benefits of other currently illegal substances, like psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and DMT. The first new studies in over 30 years are finding that these so called dangerous drugs can have a profound positive impact on mental health when used properly.\\nDepression is a growing problem and antidepressants continue not to work for up to half of the people who take them. A recent study examined the treatment of 20 patients suffering from depression. Half took antidepressants and half took psilocybin. After three months, the antidepressant effects were found to be greater for those taking psilocybin than for people taking typical antidepressants and therapy. Patients said they went from feeling “totally disconnected” with themselves and the world to “connected”, and from repressing and avoiding emotions and memories to accepting them.\\nUnlike antidepressants, which are taken daily, psilocybin therapy would take place a few times over a series of months until the patient decides that they no longer need it.\\n\\nIn most cases, only a few sessions of psilocybin are needed to bring about permanent change. Other research has found a similar positive impact on depression with the use of LSD, DMT and Ketamine. The push for more research on psychedelics is growing fast, but we still need a much deeper understanding before this becomes mainstream.","keywords":["Psychedelics cure depression","psilocybin used for depression","antidepressants","SSRI","MDMA","legalize","cannabis","magic mushrooms","Albert Hoffman","Age of Psychedelics","Psychedelic research","psilocybin study","schedule 1 drug","DMT","Ketamine","ayahuasca","medical marajuana","Hallucinogen","anxiety","mental health","therapy","after skool","compass news","johns hopkins"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNzRTEjoyA"},{"title":"Playing God - The Story of Synthetic Life","image":"yt/QC6HFEIgvDM_sm.jpg","date":"Aug 20 2018","full_title":"PLAYING GOD - The Story of Synthetic Life","views":81927,"likes":2583,"dislikes":185,"rating":4.7326589,"length_seconds":314,"published":1534809600000,"description":"Head over the Professor Dave\'s Channel for some really awesome educational videos! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cd...\\n\\nIn 2016, the first synthetic organism of original design was created. When you hear this statement, what does it make you think of? The word synthetic does imply that something was built by man. But if you’re imagining artificial intelligence, or robots, or anything mechanical, you’re way off the mark. Synthetic life refers to actual, biological, living organisms. How can such a thing be synthesized? To put this achievement into context, let’s examine the history of chemical synthesis. Up until the early 19th century, it was a widespread belief that living organisms, along with all the stuff inside them, had some kind of special essence, or life-energy. These substances could only come from other life, and not from non-life. This notion was called vitalism. But in 1828, Friedrich Wohler proved that this is not the case by synthesizing urea, a compound found in the human body. On that day, organic chemistry was born. In the decades that followed, chemists learned how to synthesize all kinds of compounds, and by the latter half of the 20th century, this field had become incredibly sophisticated, thanks to an expansive understanding of the molecular world. In 1972, a team led by Robert Burns Woodward completed a landmark synthesis of Vitamin B-12, and other efforts have yielded the possibility of mass producing compounds for use in medicine, or as materials for the development of new technologies.\\n\\nBut in a way, an echo of vitalism persists to this day. There are those who think that if humans synthesize a natural product, like a vitamin, that it must be inferior to one that nature makes. This is not so. Nature builds these molecules just like we do, and it has its own biosynthetic pathways to make them. But nature’s laboratory is inside living organisms. These are delicate systems, so chemistry must be done at a very specific temperature and pH, and only with the materials at hand. In our own laboratories, we have no such limitations. We can put whatever we want in a flask and heat it up, cool it down, use strong acids and bases, exotic compounds that don’t exist in nature, and most importantly, sentience. We can decide what chemistry to do, rather than relying on the chemistry that nature has stumbled upon by blind chance over the millenia. For this reason, we can do chemistry that nature simply can’t, and we can often arrive at the same products with much greater efficiency. Whatever the molecule might be, if nature makes it, or we make it, there’s no difference. If two molecules have the same atoms connected in the same way, they’re the same, no matter how they got there. If this were not true, the field of organic chemistry could not exist, and the field is thriving, to say the least.\\n\\nFrom simple molecules, we soon learned how to synthesize large biomolecules, like proteins and DNA. We developed techniques like solid phase peptide synthesis, which makes it absolutely trivial to synthesize any protein we want. The advent of CRISPR and gene-editing technology has made it easy to edit DNA sequences. And now, Craig Venter and his team have taken the next step. Syn 3.0 is an entire synthetic genome, consisting of only 473 genes, the fewest of any living organism. This genome, when expressed, takes the form of a single-celled organism, one that has never existed in nature. It was invented, created, built, manifested, whatever verb you want to use, by mankind. If going by a certain definition of a god, we are now one, as we have created life.\\n\\nSynthetic life is the final nail in the coffin for vitalism. What chemists have known for almost two hundred years is now clear as day for all to see. The ingredients of life can be built by humans. Beyond synthesizing basic organic compounds, we can now create an entire self-replicating living organism from scratch. What is the next step? Synthetic microorganisms that rapidly consume carbon dioxide to counteract climate change? Others that produce clean fuels? Could we even make synthetic plants and animals, creating entirely new species dreamt up purely by imagination? What should we create, and what shouldn’t we create? Time will tell, but the possibilities are truly endless.\\n\\nPlease Support After Skool on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\\nTo Check out the After Skool Graphic Novel visit our website https://www.afterskool.net/\\nFor more weekly animations, please subscribe!","keywords":["synthetic life","organic chemistry","history of chemical synthesis","syn 3.0","craig venter","artificial intelligence","playing god","synthesize molecules","protein","dna","vitalism","god created all life","professor dave explains","afterskool","chemistry","vitamin b 12","urea","Friedrich Wohler","Robert Burns Woodward","self replicating"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC6HFEIgvDM"},{"title":"Privacy is No Longer a Social Norm","image":"yt/rsKw5BkWesw_sm.jpg","date":"Aug 13 2018","full_title":"Privacy is NO LONGER a Social Norm","views":192443,"likes":8604,"dislikes":369,"rating":4.8355064,"length_seconds":393,"published":1534204800000,"description":"If you want to protect your privacy online then a VPN is critical.

Every second you are online, your behavior is being tracked and stored into a file that can be sold to companies trying to sell products to you. Even when you’re not online, your phone is listening. In this age of technology, privacy seems to be something of the past. There is an illusion that the internet is free, but the fact is your personal information is worth a lot, and you end up paying dearly for it in the end.\\n\\nTo most people, the lack of privacy doesn’t seem like a big deal. Constant surveillance goes hand in hand with the internet. Only 3% of people who use google have actually read the terms and conditions that they agreed to. There is a sentiment today that only “bad people” want privacy. Only those with things to hide care about privacy. But the fact of the matter is we all do things when we think we’re alone that we would never do out in public. There are things we say to those we trust in confidence that would mortify us if they were got out.\\n\\nWhen we’re in a state where we are being monitored our behavior changes. There are plenty of social science experiments to back this up. One the most famous experiments was developed by an English Philosopher named Jeremy Bentham in 1791. At the time, prisons in England were overcrowded and there weren’t enough guards to keep order. So Bentham designed a new type of prison structure, called the panopticon, which allowed all inmates to be observed at all times by a single guard. In the panopticon prison, every inmate was separated into a cell that faced inward towards one guard tower. The guard in the tower sat in the dark and stared out through a tiny window which was covered with shutters; so the guard could see out and no one could see in. Since the inmates could not see the guard in the tower, it created the illusion that they were being watched at all times. This design had such a profound impact on the inmates behavior, that all riots and resistance ceased. Just knowing that they were visible was enough to keep the inmates in line. In fact, In order for this to work, they didn’t even need a guard in the tower. All that was needed was the fear of potentially being watched at all times.\\n\\nconstant surveillance creates a prison in the mind. The panopticon proved to be the ultimate enforcer of obedience and compliance and this same principle has been carried over to schools, hospitals, airports, the workplace and now practically every public corner of society.\\n\\nTo those in authoritative power, Anyone who poses a meaningful challenge to authority must be stopped. So Essentially, If you completely render yourself harmless and conforming in every way possible as someone who poses no threat whatsoever, then you have nothing to worry about. .\\n\\nHere’s a powerful quote from 19th century philosopher, Rosa Luxemburg “Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.”\\n\\nMaybe not today, but someday you will want to explore an idea that doesn’t conform to the ever narrowing standards of society and when that time comes wouldn’t you like the freedom to act without being judged or surveillanced. Privacy is a basic human right.\\n\\nFor more interesting videos please subscribe.

Our materialist science reduces everything to matter, materialist science in the West says that we are just meat, we’re just our bodies. So when the brain is dead, that’s the end of consciousness, there is no life after death, there is no soul; we just rot and are gone. Actually, many honest scientists should admit that consciousness is the greatest mystery of science and that we don’t know exactly how it works. The brain is involved in it some way but we’re not sure how. It could be that the brain generates consciousness the way a generator makes electricity, if you hold to that paradigm, then of course you can’t believe in life after death, when the generator’s broken, consciousness is gone. But it’s equally possible that the relationship — and nothing in neuroscience rules it out – that the relationship is more like the relationship of the TV signal to the TV set, and in that case, when the TV set is broken, of course the TV signal continues. And this is the paradigm of all spiritual traditions, that we are immortal souls temporarily incarnated in these physical forms.\\n\\nIf we want to understand consciousness, the last people we should ask are materialist scientists. Instead, we should look at ancient cultures, like the Egyptians, who highly valued dream states. Many ancient cultures around the world used hallucinogenic plants to understand consciousness and expand their minds.\\n\\nHowever in today\'s society, visionary plants are highly illegal because they promote a state of consciousness that does not agree with the agenda of profit. Substances, like coffee, alcohol, sugar and pharmaceuticals, are forced upon the population, but possession of even small quantities of cannabis, Ayahuasca or psilocybin will land you in jail. If we do not recognize the right of adult sovereignty over consciousness, then we can NOT claim to be free.\\n\\nLook at what our moderns state of consciousness has done. We have destroyed the natural gifts of earth in pursuit of short-term, selfish gain. We must reconnect with spirit immediately or else we will encounter disaster. Visionary plants could be the remedy for our current sickness.\\n\\nDisclaimer: We are not promoting risky, illegal or dangerous behavior. Do your research before taking any action.

But some substances, like neonicotinoids, kill not only pests but bees as well. Now the Bayer Group, one of the main manufacturers of these pesticides, is coming under pressure.\\n\\nScientists around the world have found that neonicotinoids are the main cause of mass bee deaths. Research has shown that a number of insecticides should have been banned long ago. For years, the Bayer Group has sought to silence the critics and pressure scientists into not publishing their findings.\\n\\nFor more than two decades, experts have been warning of the negative effects of neonicotinoids, with a whole range of studies published on the subject. It would appear that the industry, aided by the authorities, managed to successfully delay any ban on these substances for years. Studies show that neonicotinoids not only kill pests, but also bees and other beneficial insects. Dutch toxicologist Henk Tennekes was among the first to recognize the problem. He believes neonicotinoids are the most toxic insecticides ever produced. He discovered a study carried out by Bayer itself, back in 1991, which found that a particular neonicotinoid had a negative effect on the nervous system of a fly species. These effects were said to be \\"irreversible”. Tennekes then confronted the company with his findings. He was taken aback by the response: \\"Bayer now claims” he says, \\"that the binding of critical receptors in the nervous system by neonicotinoids is reversible. So they’re contradicting the results of their own study.  ... If they had considered what impact this substance has, they would have had to take it off the market.\\" \\n\\nScientists in France also analyzed mass bee deaths and likewise identified an insecticide made by Bayer as the culprit. Toxicologist Jean-Marc Bonmatin reveals how the company then sought to prevent the results from being published. Meanwhile, toxicologists in Japan discovered that neonicotinoids also harm other creatures, such as fish and river crabs. There too, Bayer sought to suppress publication.  \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But does 3D printing make everything better? This film shows how innovation can change the world of goods.\\n\\nIs the way we make things about to become the next revolution? Traditional manufacturing techniques like milling, casting and gluing could soon be replaced by 3D printing -saving enormous amounts of material and energy. Aircraft maker Airbus is already benefiting from the new manufacturing method. Beginning this year, the A350 airliner will fly with printed door locking shafts. Where previously ten parts had to be installed, today that’s down to just one. It saves a lot of manufacturing steps. And 3D printing can imitate nature\'s efficient construction processes, something barely possible in conventional manufacturing. Another benefit of the new technology is that components can become significantly lighter and more robust, and material can be saved during production. But the Airbus development team is not yet satisfied. The printed cabin partition in the A350 has become 45 percent lighter thanks to the new structure, but it is complex and expensive to manufacture. It takes 900 hours to print just one partition, a problem that print manufacturers have not yet been able to solve. The technology is already being used in Adidas shoes: The sportswear company says it is currently the world’s largest manufacturer of 3D-printed components. The next step is sustainable materials, such as biological synthetic resins that do not use petroleum and can be liquefied again without loss of quality and are therefore completely recyclable. This documentary sheds light on the diverse uses of 3D printing.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It can cause outrage - but hunting can offer a way to preserve nature and protect threatened species. Such as the one-hundred elephants that will be resettled in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nAngry online commentators agree: trophy hunting is reprehensible, immoral and absolutely unnecessary. But is it really that simple? There are hunting projects that guarantee the survival of endangered species - provided they are managed well.\\n\\nSango, a private game reserve in southeastern Zimbabwe, is owned by German businessman Wilfried Pabst. Sixty percent of Sango’s operating costs is financed through what it calls sustainable use - in other words, trophy hunting. Pabst has faced enormous hostility, but is that fair? The concept behind Sango is to allow some animals to be hunted to generate capital to support the rest. Pabst has been so successful with this model that he now has too many animals of various species for Sango or Zimbabwe to support.\\n\\nThe elephants in particular are a huge problem. The giant pachyderms spend around 20 hours a day eating, and destroy their own habitat. Pabst has to reduce their number to protect the habitat. He gets permission to cull 100 elephants - but he loves his animals and looks for alternatives. He finds a surprising way out.\\n\\nHundreds of kilometers further north is picturesque Rifa on the Zambezi River. Another German businessman, Ralph Koczwara, leases the land and comes up with a spectacular idea. The elephants should be relocated. A unique rescue maneuver begins.

But what decisions can technology make on our behalf? How far can it go? AI is still in its infancy.\\n\\nCharlie is supposed to explore the Moon for us sometime.  But no human lives will be at risk during his mission, because Charlie\'s a machine. The simian-like robot is currently still earthbound: he can currently be seen trying somewhat helplessly to navigate a papier mâché mock-up of the lunar surface at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Kaiserlsautern. Professor Wolfgang Wahlster, co-founder of the institution and, until recently, its boss, believes Charlie can be of great not only in space, but also here on Earth. He says intelligent robots could carry out dangerous jobs, search for victims buried in earthquakes or seal off a radioactive nuclear power plant after a meltdown. But what are AI’s limits? Can an autonomous car decide for itself whether it run over a child in the road or swerve into groups of people on the sidewalk instead? Our professional lives will also change. AI will make many jobs obsolete too - although it will also create new ones. The renowned Professor Wolfgang Wahlster believes that it will be down to politicians and society to define ethical boundaries. Meanwhile, he himself has become more humble. Forty years of research in the field of AI has given him a huge respect for human intelligence, which he says we are still light years away from being able to reproduce.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Their aim is to build a habitable research station on the Moon. What is the current state of play in international lunar research?\\n\\nFor four and a half billion years, the Moon has been the Earth’s constant companion. Fifty years after man first set foot on its surface, researchers around the world are again working flat out on a new lunar mission to the Moon with the aim of setting up a habitable research station there. In 1969, the American astronaut Neil Armstrong spent less than a day on the Moon. Now the aim is to actually be able to live there. However, there are still some significant obstacles to overcome. Unprotected by any atmosphere, the Moon’s surface is exposed to a hundred times more radiation than the Earth, and any habitable Moon base will have to solve this problem. But how will they be able to build a module where researchers can live and work for months at all? Engineers and scientists are working on ways to use Moon dust, which is similar to basalt, as a building material. Another problem is that space suits have mainly been designed for space travel and they are unsuitable for use in low gravity conditions - the Moon’s gravity is just a sixth of the Earth’s. The German Aerospace Center’s EDEN ISS project is testing ways to cultivate food in a hostile environment in Antarctica, growing tomatoes and cucumbers are grown in a closed-circuit container. The filmmakers visit research institutes all over the world to get up-to-date answers to the most crucial questions about lunar research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Others believe it makes people more capable, efficient and creative. In Silicon Valley, many even say LSD can be a tool for self-improvement.\\n\\nMore and more people in Germany are discovering what’s known as microdosing in order to be the best they can be. Every three days, a 28-year-old man takes his LSD out of the freezer and slowly lets the ice cube containing the drug melt on his tongue. He’s taking ten micrograms of LSD. He learned about it online and says the allegedly harmless dose makes him feel more focused, productive and empathetic.\\nThe trend from Silicon Valley is an open secret at many innovative start-up companies. Paul Austin, who’s something of an LSD guru in Silicon Valley says, \\"People who responsibly take psychedelic drugs in microdoses will rule the job markets of the future.” But others are sceptical. They warn about self-medication, saying there’s no way of knowing the LSD’s concentration. If things go wrong, psychoses and persistent sensory disorders may follow. But this documentary shows there is more to it. After years of being locked away with the poisons, \'acid\' is back and a hit among a new generation of researchers and doctors. Some say it can ease depression and anxiety. So is LSD good medicine? This film explores the past and present of a drug that was legal until the 1960s and was used by doctors to treat the blues and alcohol addiction.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For months now thousands of people have been taking to the streets to protest against the increasing influence of China. Demonstrators and police have clashed repeatedly.\\n\\nIn this video diary five eye witnesses give their account of the protests over the last few months. The bloggers filmed the majority of the video footage themselves, chronicling the unrest in the semi-autonomous territory in an unusual and arrestingly direct fashion. \\n\\nIn February 2019 the Hong Kong government announced draft legislation that would have allowed the extradition of its residents to mainland China. Critics feared it would open the backdoor to Beijing. Hong Kong may be part of China, but it enjoys special rights like freedom of speech and assembly under the one country, two systems policy. These proposed changes to the extradition laws sparked an ongoing wave of protests, which have repeatedly turned violent. \\n\\nAfter demonstrators stormed the Hong Kong’s legislature and the escalation of protests at Hong Kong airport, chief executive Carrie Lam announced in early September that she was scrapping the controversial extradition bill. But, by then, the protests had already become about far more than that. The demonstrators had started calling for free elections and an independent Hong Kong. On October 4, Lam invoked emergency powers in a bid to impose a ban on wearing masks, sparking further unrest. An end of the conflict is still not in sight. \\n\\nThe video diary ‘My Hong Kong’ contains five very personal accounts of the turbulent events in Hong Kong over the last few months.

Our film team meets entomologists, farmers, scientists, chemical companies and politicians in a bid to lay bare the causes of insect mortality.\\n\\nInsects aren’t really likeable. They sting, bite, transmit diseases and frighten children. But, on the other hand, they are also fascinating: 480 million years ago, insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and they took over the Earth. Even now, they are fundamental to life on Earth, and are at the beginning of the food chain on which all human beings are ultimately dependent.\\nBut insect numbers worldwide are dropping, creating a rupture of  the food chain. Environmentalists and scientists are now extremely worried. Landscape ecology professor Alexandra-Maria Klein from Freiburg, for example, has been researching the effects of human interventions in natural environments for decades and has launched an experiment in a fruit plantation on Lake Constance: What happens when insects disappear? An ominous silence is settling on places that were once humming and buzzing. Why are the insects dying? Author Christoph Würzburger takes a journey into the fascinating world of insects and meets entomologists, farmers, scientists, chemical companies and politicians in a search for the causes of insect mortality.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How will AI change our society in the future?\\n\\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported \'social credit system\' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI’s social implications?\\n\\nA documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the ‘white gold’ rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use \\"natural commodities conscientiously.” But many car drivers don’t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don’t recycle used tires more effectively. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Now Bayer is also liable for Monsanto’s legal bills - which are starting to mount alarmingly.\\n\\nRoundup, a herbicide containing glyphosate sold worldwide by Monsanto has long been suspected of causing cancer. A California court has just awarded more than $2 billion in damages to a couple who had claimed that their use of the pesticide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma . Bayer’s share price halved last year, and the consequences are already making themselves felt in the company itself: Around 12,000 jobs worldwide are to be cut in the next few years, a considerable proportion of them in Germany. CEO Werner Baumann, who pushed for the merger, is coming under increasing pressure. Voicing criticism, a majority of shareholders voted against absolving Baumann and other managers of their responsibility in the merger. Bayer is in the midst of its greatest crisis.\\n\\nThe film traces the effects of the merger and investigates potential new health hazards emanating from glyphosate. How has Monsanto tried in the past to influence politicians, scientists and public opinion? Did the Americans actually play down or ignore the dangers? And does Bayer really distance itself from these practices?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSubscribe to DW Documentary:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q?sub_confirmation=1#\\n\\nOur other YouTube channels:\\nDW Documental (in spanish): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocumental\\nDW Documentary وثائقية دي دبليو: (in arabic): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocarabia\\n\\nFor more documentaries visit also:\\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/tv/docfilm/s-3610\\nInstagram\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dwdocumentary/\\nFacebook:\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dw.stories\\n\\nDW netiquette policy: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G","keywords":["Documentary","Documentaries","documentaries","DW documentary","DW documentary 2019","full documentary","documentary 2019","DW","beyond the news","Bayer","Monsanto","glyphosate","mergers","seeds","carcinogenic","investigative","globalization","Roundup herbicide","cancerogen herbicide","BAYER CEO Werner Baumann","bayer chemistry","chemical industry"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwllBdC0Iww"},{"title":"From rainforest to charcoal","image":"yt/WDP-j5RdSUU_sm.jpg","date":"Aug 28 2019","full_title":"From rainforest to charcoal | DW Documentary","views":347241,"likes":2580,"dislikes":141,"rating":4.7927232,"length_seconds":2546,"published":1566950400000,"description":"Huge areas of tropical rainforest are being destroyed to make charcoal for barbecues. The global deforestation is leading to growing problems. Nigeria and the DRC Congo - two of Europe’s main charcoal suppliers - are also affected.\\n\\nEvery year, Europeans use approximately 800,000 tons of charcoal for barbecuing. Seventy percent of the charcoal comes from outside the EU, and the bags often contain remnants of tropical woods. Officially, tropical woods are subject to strict import conditions. But when it comes to wood charcoal, these do not apply. \\nWorldwide, 2.7 billion people cook and heat with wood or charcoal. The related emission of greenhouse gases is enormous. 55 percent of global wood is used as fuel per year, and much of it is cut illegally in Africa’s bush and tropical forests. Nigeria produces most of its charcoal for export. Especially during dry periods, local Nigerian farmers use coal production as a lifeline to make money and feed their families. At the same time, charcoal mills travel the countryside in family groups, charring all the trees they can cut down. The consequences are hair-raising. Nigeria lost 36 percent of its forests between 1990 and 2005. At present, twelve percent of the country is still covered with forest - but charcoal production continues to rise, eating up 350,000 hectares of fertile land here every year. According to the UN, charcoal production is one of the main causes of deforestation in Africa, which in turn is closely linked to massive deterioration in soil quality and a growing risk of crop failure. But African legislation has been slow to respond to the problem. The coal business is highly lucrative business, and rakes in some 7.4 billion US Dollars a year. According to recent estimates, the current illegal trade in charcoal is worth almost three times as much as the trade in illegal drugs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

And now, the dangers caused by tons of melting ice are rising sharply. Every year, climate change is destroying two of the currently 70 square kilometers of glaciers left in the Alps.\\n\\nThe permafrost in the Alps is thawing, and transforming what used to be sturdy slopes into loose screes. In addition, climate change is leading to significantly more extreme weather conditions every year, while heavy rainfall causes serious erosion. The result: avalanches and landslides like those in Bondo, Switzerland, or Valsertal in Austria.\\nIn Switzerland, residential areas are shrinking as people are forced to leave their homes forever. The disappearance of glaciers as water reservoirs is already posing a major problem. Farmers in Engadine, who have been using meltwater for irrigation for centuries, are already facing water shortages. Last summer, they had to rely on helicopters to transport water to their herds in the Grison Alps. Above all, alpine villages depend on winter tourism to survive. Yet experts are forecasting that by mid-century, there will only be enough natural snow left to ski above 2,000 meters, which will spell out the end for about 70 percent of the ski resorts in the Eastern Alps. But instead of developing alternatives, lots of money is still being invested in ski tourism. Snow cannon are used to defy climate change, and artificial snow systems are under construction at ever higher altitudes. As usual, it’s the environment that is set to lose as the unique alpine landscape is further destroyed by soil compaction and erosion. Some municipalities are now working on new models of alpine tourism for the future. As global temperatures continue to rise, the cooler mountain regions will become increasingly attractive for tourists, especially in the summer.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But does the FSC really prevent illegal deforestation?\\n\\nPrimeval forests are shrinking at an increasing rate. Is exploitation of the well-intentioned FSC system failing to prevent illegal deforestation and thus deceiving consumers? The jungles of Cambodia have been all but destroyed since 2000, and now just 25 square kilometers remain. Deforestation is responsible for more CO2 emissions than all the world’s cars and trucks put together. The Bonn-based Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is responsible for the certification of sustainable forestry worldwide and its certification is considered to be the most important eco-label. It is supposed to help consumers to identify furniture, paper, planks and other goods made from \\"environmentally friendly” timber. The FSC has certified the management of more than 200 million hectares of forest to date - an area about the size of Western Europe. But what has the FSC achieved in 25 years? Manfred Ladwig and Thomas Reutter spent months filming deforestation around the world and discovered that companies accused of processing illegal timber do not necessarily lose their FSC certification and even a company condemned for illegal logging in the Brazilian rainforest can continue to use it. The film investigates the connections between the FSC, illegal deforestation and the displacement of indigenous peoples and throws an unsparing light on the global timber industry.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The victims are entitled to justice.\\" In September 2018, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, head of the German Bishops’ Conference, uttered these words and apologized to all victims of sexual abuse by Catholic officials in Germany. But Matthias Katsch, one of the most prominent representatives of victims in Germany, maintains that the Church’s handling of abuse remains problematic even now. A former pupil at the private Canisius-Kolleg school and spokesperson for the \\"Squared Table” victims’ initiative uncovered the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church in Germany in 2010. For over thirty years, his abusers’ crimes had stayed covered up. Then, Matthias Katsch and his former classmates broke the silence when they turned to the public with accusations against their former teachers - Jesuit priests Peter R. and Wolfgang S. And what happened next? Not much, it seems. Both men were spotted in Chile after 2010. Impatient with the lack of progress, Matthias Katsch took matters into his own hands and set out to Chile to find the abusers - and their next victims. Filmmaker Eva Müller went with him.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In Germany, such incidents have tripled over the last 10 years, whilst in the USA it’s five times as many. \\n\\nJürgen Thoma, who needed a new hip in 2005, says \\"We were the guinea pigs\\". He was recommended a new product, an \\"innovation\\" better than anything on the market so far. But this \\"innovation\\" has probably caused massive suffering to hundreds of people. The metal in the prostheses deteriorated due to abrasion and many patients suffered from metal poisoning that ate into their bones. Thomas Woska suffered years of pain until a defective prosthetic disc was removed from his back in a lengthy operation. The prosthesis had disintegrated, distributing fragments of plastic along the channel of his spinal cord. Internal documents from companies and ministries and countless conversations with industry representatives and whistleblowers show that side effects are repeatedly concealed. The authorities usually leave it to the manufacturers to recall defective products or issue safety warnings. Since 2010, this has happened around 1000 times a year, an average of about three times a day, but the authorities seem to have ordered only six recalls during the same period. Often nothing at all is done about defective products. Doctors regularly implant products that have hardly been tested. Internal documents from 2016 show that even the Ministry of Health assumes that only one in ten medical devices with the highest risk levels has been clinically tested, and the public is largely unaware of the risks. By linking compensation payments to obligations of confidentiality, companies prevent patients from talking about their cases. More than 250 journalists from almost 60 different media companies were involved in the worldwide research into medical products under the title \\"The Implant Files,\\" including the BBC, Le Monde and representatives from Japan, Pakistan, Mexico, Tunisia and many European countries.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Who decides how Germany should look? These questions are the subject of the film \\"Land of Inequality - Power.”\\n\\nMany studies show that a small but wealthy part of society defines a country’s political direction. It’s the same all over the world. German researchers evaluated hundreds of opinion polls on the topics of the economy, environment, foreign policy and finance. They then examined what poor people wanted from politics on these issues - and what the rich did. The differences were clear: \\"An obvious example is taxes on property,” says Armin Schäfer, a political scientist at the University of Munster. \\"Higher income groups are more skeptical about any reintroduction of a property tax, whereas lower income groups definitely want it. So far, we have not reintroduced a property tax in that form.” So who gets to decide what Germany looks like? To find out, our film follows building contractor Christoph Gröner, who has made millions from the construction business. Gröner wants to build an entire new district in Cologne, which is facing a severe housing shortfall and where rents are soaring and the poor in particular feel ignored. But he has faced delays in getting building permits. Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker says: \\"It is a city’s job to provide land and grant building permits.” But can’t it do that faster? Gröner says the politicians should take their foot off the brakes. To show how much power money really wields, we go to the places where politics and economics come together - to the district town halls and the VIP box at a Bundesliga stadium. And to Europe\'s largest real estate show in Cannes, where billionaire investors use their financial clout to shape cities and regions as they wish.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But things have gotten tougher for Elon Musk’s crown jewel company. The race to dominate the market for the car of the future has entered a critical phase.\\n\\nTesla has set new standards in the automotive industry. For years, its CEO was as celebrated as any rock star. But both the boss and his company are coming under increased fire from critics. Employees have claimed working conditions at production facilities are chaotic and often questionable. Production on the Tesla assembly lines has often been brought to a standstill. Meanwhile, losses are growing, while Musk’s reputation has also become somewhat dented and scratched. Meanwhile, other major car brands are working at top speed to bump Tesla from its pole position, with Porsche leading the pack. Little is known about the German carmaker’s new electric Taycan model, but this documentary reveals just how dangerous a new electric Porsche could be for Tesla. And major carmakers have another trump card to play. They have decades of experience in the mass production of cars, while Tesla is still a newcomer to the field. The film also shows how much German technology is hidden in Tesla models, and how both Musk and new Chinese competition are betting on German expertise. The race to dominate the market for electric cars is far from over.\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A survey of almost 600 German farmers has revealed that more than one in two now uses digital solutions to optimize their harvests.

The son of two teachers, he has worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\\n\\nChristoph Gröner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children\'s home. Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \\"What we see here is total failure across the board,” he says. \\"It starts with parents who just don’t get it and can’t do anything right. And then there’s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\\" Chistoph Gröner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality?\\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany’s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \\"Land of Inequality\\" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children’s outlooks.\\n_______\\nWatch Part I\\nInequality - how wealth becomes power\\nhttps://youtu.be/AFIxi7BiScI\\nPart 3 Inequality - how wealth becomes power\\nhttps://youtu.be/wEufTD39xrw\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind.\\n\\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gröner, one of Germany’s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \\"If you have great wealth, you can’t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,” Gröner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  \\"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we’re more independent,” Gröner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanović, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \\"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\\" Milanović notes. \\"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?”\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The rich consume much more than the poor and produce much more waste. Trash has become a symbol of our times.\\n\\nBut what some people throw away, means money to others and a chance to survive. The amount of waste we generate and the way we deal with it speak volumes about our consumption and prosperity - and also about our levels of social inequality. In the documentary, \\"The Rich, the Poor and the Trash,\\" co-directors Naomi Phillips and Thomas Hasel explore the lives of people both working with and living off trash. Twenty-eight-year-old Godwin Ochieng lives in Dandora, a slum in Kenya, where one of the largest dumpsites in Africa is located. He spends his days combing through endless piles of garbage coming in the truckload from the city’s wealthier districts in the hope of finding something to sell: for him, the mountain of trash is a lifeline. One person who tries to help youths in the slum is Godwin Ochieng\'s role model, hip-hop star Juliani, who also comes from Dandora. The founder of the youth club wants to radically change Kenyan society. Meanwhile, halfway around the globe in one of the world’s richest and most expensive cities, Pierre Simmons searches the streets of New York for cans he can sell to recycling companies. In 2014, Pierre Simmons gave a speech about poverty to the United Nations on behalf of “Sure we can”, a non-profit recycling center in New York. “I don\'t think anybody here at Sure We Can wants to live like Wall Street people,” says Pierre. Both men live in countries where the gap between rich and poor is vast. But the social gap between the US and Kenya is also huge. Economists Lucas Chancel and Kate Raworth warn against the consequences of a huge imbalance at both the national and international levels. They believe it poses a great danger to our entire system of values in the West, to our understanding of democracy and, ultimately, to our economy.\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?\\n\\nIs organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk \\"organic\\" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What danger lies in wait for average citizens?\\n\\nFor years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\\n\\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \\"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film \'The Money Deluge\' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\\n_______\\n\\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

How much is enough? Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.\\n\\nSome call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can\'t people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?\\n\\n\\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today\'s materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.\\n\\nAnyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \\"The Greed Program,\\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.\\n\\nCheck out our web special:\\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/tv/greed/s-32898\\n_______\\n\\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

But should they draw the line at mocking religion?\\n\\nAll around the world, religion has increasingly become a political issue that can spawn terrorism and violence. Extremist religious groups divide the world into believers and infidels, and blasphemy is an explosive issue. \\n\\nThe fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie and the terrorist attack on the satirical magazine \\"Charlie Hebdo\\" in Paris are just two incidents that have turned the debate about blasphemy into a standoff between the proponents of freedom of expression and those who insist on respect for religion. Artists and cartoonists in particular have long faced accusations of blasphemy when they have consciously attacked religious institutions. Our film examines the debate about blasphemy in art and asks representatives of all faiths how they see it. It also looks back at the origins of religion and the history of blasphemy. We present works by artists, filmmakers and caricaturists that have been described as blasphemous, sometimes with extremely serious consequences. They include Kurt Westergaard, who has been under police protection since the publication of the Mohammed cartoons, or Gerhard Haderer, whose Jesus cartoons attracted the wrath of the Catholic Church.\\n_______\\n\\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

The system sees them as traitors. What are they really?   \\n\\nIn the authorities’ eyes, they are traitors, yet the public at large often sees them as heroes. People are driven to whistleblowing by anger, disbelief and powerlessness. It is a decision from which there is no turning back, a moment when someone obeys their conscience regardless of the consequences. It marks the beginning of a battle against the system in which old allies become enemies.\\n\\nRevelations by whistleblowers such as Swiss Leaks bring tax authorities around the world billions in revenue. They uncover corruption, data abuse and war crimes - without whistleblowers, the world would be a more naive place. Behind each story, however, is a personal fate: when the auditor Rudolf Elmer disclosed illegal business methods by Swiss banks, his life turned into a thriller. Stéphanie Gibaud, too, a marketing employee at UBS was first put under massive peer pressure and then fired. This is the price that most whistleblowers have to pay - just like Swen Ennullat, who had the gall to cry foul twice!\\n_______ \\n\\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Learn more about how this new way to analyze medical information could lead to earlier detection of life-threatening illnesses and bring AI-assisted diagnosis to more health care settings worldwide.\\n\\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\\n\\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world\'s leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America\'s 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men\'s Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn\'t lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
