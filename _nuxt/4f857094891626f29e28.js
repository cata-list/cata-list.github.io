The Treatise first explains how we form such concepts as cause and effect, external existence, and personal identity, and to form compelling but unconfirmable beliefs in the entities represented by these concepts. It then offers a novel account of the passions, explains freedom and necessity as they apply to human choices and actions, and concludes with detailed explanations of how we distinguish between virtue and vice and of the different kinds of virtue.","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":"http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/hume/section1/"},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4705"},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":"https://github.com/GITenberg/A-Treatise-of-Human-Nature_4705"},{"title":"Wikisource","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_of_Human_Nature"},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"File","link":""},{"title":"Amazon","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Human-Nature-David-Hume/dp/1466297468/?tag=mmdev-20"}]},{"title":"Critique of Pure Reason","author":"Immanuel Kant","year":"1781","goodreadsRating":"3.92","plot":"Kant explains that by a critique of pure reason he means not \'a critique of books and systems, but of the faculty of reason in general, in respect of all knowledge after which it may strive independently of all experience\' and that he aims to reach a decision about \'the possibility or impossibility of metaphysics in general\'.

Locke also distinguishes between the truly existing primary qualities of bodies, like shape, motion and the arrangement of minute particles, and the secondary qualities that are \'powers to produce various sensations in us\' such as \'red\' and \'sweet.\' These secondary qualities, Locke claims, are dependent on the primary qualities. He also offers a theory of personal identity, offering a largely psychological criterion. Book III is concerned with language, and Book IV with knowledge, including intuition, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy (\'science\'), faith, and opinion.","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":"https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/e/an-essay-concerning-human-understanding/book-summary"},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":"http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/lockeessay/"},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10615"},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":"https://github.com/GITenberg/An-Essay-Concerning-Humane-Understanding-Volume-1--13-MDCXC-Based-on-the-2nd-Edition-Books-1-__10615"},{"title":"Wikisource","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding"},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"File","link":""},{"title":"Amazon","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Essay-Concerning-Understanding-Hackett-Classics/dp/087220216X/?tag=mmdev-20"}]},{"title":"Everything Is Under Control","author":"Robert Anton Wilson","year":"1998","goodreadsRating":"3.76","plot":"Covers the range of Robert Anton Wilson\'s kaleidoscopic knowledge, from John Adams to the Voronezh (former Soviet Union) UFO sighting, the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu to the Mothman prophecies, and everything in between.

His detailed account of those sessions is an inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical that is also manufactured by the human brain, consistently produced near-death and mystical experiences.
