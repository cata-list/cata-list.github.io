The range of possible uses of the term is similar to that for shadow government. In popular usage, the term carries overwhelmingly negative connotations, although this does not reflect scholarly understanding. Potential sources for deep state organization include rogue elements among organs of state, such as the armed forces or public authorities (intelligence agencies, police, secret police, administrative agencies, and government bureaucracy). A deep state can also take the form of entrenched career civil servants acting in a non-conspiratorial discretionary manner to further their agency mission or the public good, sometimes in contravention of the current political administration. The intent of a deep state can include continuity of the state itself, job security, enhanced power and authority, and the pursuit of ideological or programmatic objectives. It can operate in opposition to the agenda of elected officials, by obstructing, resisting, and subverting their policies, conditions and directives. The expression state within a state is an older and close concept. Historically, it designated a well defined organization which seeks to function independently, whereas the deep state refers more to a hidden organization seeking to manipulate the public state.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg","logo":""},{"title":"Deep State in the United States","source":"Wikipedia","author":"","date":"","id":"m-2-BBH_eb_XidoJ2RU5R","data_updated":"Friday, December 11, 2020 11:16 AM","description":"The deep state is a conspiracy theory which suggests that collusion and cronyism exist within the U.S. political system and constitute a hidden government within the legitimately elected government.

The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham (c.  1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian who used a preference for simplicity to defend the idea of divine miracles. This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.\\nSimilarly, in science, Occam\'s razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occam\'s razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.

It is therefore a type of programmable matter, wherein after the fabrication process, the printed product reacts with parameters within the environment (humidity, temperature, etc.,) and changes its form accordingly. The ability to do so arises from the near infinite configurations at a micrometer resolution, creating solids with engineered molecular spatial distributions and thus allowing unprecedented multifunctional performance."},{"title":"MIT Researchers Created a System That Prints Functional Drones and Robots","source":"Engadget","author":"Kris Holt","date":"Feb 8, 2021","id":"pqqiBeiGfI6QXylb-U2WC","data_updated":"Wednesday, February 17, 2021 11:13 AM","description":"LaserFactory cuts out a shape, then adds circuitry and components.","link":"https://www.engadget.com/mit-laserfactory-system-drones-robots-electronics-150215803.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5i_YhHOeh.arg8_.u5TWEA--~B/aD0yNTc4O3c9NDAwOTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/5aa97430-6a1e-11eb-bec7-40a6c4237ab9","logo":"https://s.yimg.com/kw/assets/favicon-160x160.png"},{"title":"Researchers Find a Faster, More Efficient Way to 3D Print","source":"Gizmodo","author":"John Biggs","date":"Jan 05, 2021","id":"K19IxPVswrmSdzB_DVfrA","data_updated":"Wednesday, January 6, 2021 12:16 PM","description":"Two researchers at Penn State have created a new system for five-axis additive 3D-printing that reduces the amount and density of support materials needed for making printed objects.","link":"https://gizmodo.com/researchers-find-a-faster-more-efficient-way-to-3d-pri-1845992030","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/fkjpvuyhkvtns4lqcef6.jpg","logo":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/fdj3buryz5nuzyf2k620.png"},{"title":"Physicists 3D Print a Boat That Could Sail Down a Human Hair","source":"Gizmodo","author":"John Biggs","date":"Oct 25, 2020","id":"T3VMUXIKVU_Ncj8ArAs7q","data_updated":"Sunday, October 25, 2020 12:09 PM","description":"Researchers at Leiden University have 3D printed the smallest boat in the world: a 30-micrometer copy of Benchy the tug boat, a well-known 3D printer test object.

Research has recently shown that beaked and blue whales are sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar and move rapidly away from the source of the sonar, a response that disrupts their feeding and can cause mass strandings.  Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation or \'biosonar\' systems to locate predators and prey. It is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating. The study has shown whales experience decompression sickness, a disease that forces nitrogen into gas bubbles in the tissues and is caused by rapid and prolonged surfacing. Although whales were originally thought to be immune to this disease, sonar has been implicated in causing behavioral changes that can lead to decompression sickness."},{"title":"America\'s Obsession With Wipes Is Tearing Up Sewer Systems","source":"Bloomberg","author":"Gerald Porter, Jr.","date":"Mar 26, 2021","id":"UApdivxzBgnAZ03AAPd8N","data_updated":"Saturday, April 3, 2021 8:13 AM","description":"Across the U.S., cities and towns are being forced to throw more money at solving blockages as consumers buy (and flush) more wipes than ever.","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/pandemic-wipes-create-sewer-clogging-fatbergs","image":null,"logo":null},{"title":"Deforestation and Palm Oil Plantations Are Fueling a Disease Boom, Study Suggests","source":"Gizmodo","author":"Ed Cara","date":"Mar 24, 2021","id":"28pIWIKm_aT0dbA1l2EdN","data_updated":"Saturday, March 27, 2021 11:25 AM","description":"New research presents evidence that activities such as deforestation, building palm oil plantations, and even converting grassy areas into new forests are associated with outbreaks of disease, particularly those transmitted by mosquitoes and other vector animals.","link":"https://earther.gizmodo.com/deforestation-and-palm-oil-plantations-are-fueling-a-di-1846543313","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/j9yrde5qmfq8mjucpovj.jpg","logo":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/eir2ldhuj6n1thhxrcpq.png"},{"title":"Australia to Rescue Thousands as Sydney Faces Worst Floods in 60 Years","source":"Reuters","author":"Jill Gralow, Renju Jose","date":"Mar 22, 2021","id":"4TGXX7dwIBOUX0rBl0_oY","data_updated":"Monday, March 22, 2021 11:00 AM","description":"Australia was set on Monday to evacuate thousands more people from suburbs in Sydney\'s west, battered by the worst flooding in 60 years, with torrential rains expected to continue for another day or two.","link":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-weather/australia-to-evacuate-thousands-as-sydney-faces-worst-floods-in-60-years-idUSKBN2BE011","image":"https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210322&t=2&i=1555690071&r=LYNXMPEH2L05A&w=800","logo":"https://www.reuters.com/article/_next/static/images/favicon-196x196-052cc719f1ac872e3544e51801338b46.png"},{"title":"World Wastes 1 Billion Tons of Food a Year, and It\'s Frying the Planet","source":"Gizmodo","author":"Dharna Noor","date":"Mar 5, 2021","id":"uD0VbsQeH1fB3mPM60tzH","data_updated":"Monday, March 8, 2021 11:32 AM","description":"If you\'ve ever overstuffed your fridge and let some leftovers go bad in the back of it, you\'re not alone.

The replication crisis affects the social sciences and medicine most severely. The crisis has long-standing roots; the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem. The replication crisis represents an important body of research in the field of metascience.Because the reproducibility of experimental results is an essential part of the scientific method, the inability to replicate the studies of others has potentially grave consequences for many fields of science in which significant theories are grounded on unreproducible experimental work. The replication crisis has been particularly widely discussed in the field of psychology and in medicine, where a number of efforts have been made to re-investigate classic results, to determine both the reliability of the results and, if found to be unreliable, the reasons for the failure of replication.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Ioannidis_%282005%29_Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False.pdf","logo":""},{"title":"Justice Dept.

According to the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons official statement, \'He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff.\' The New York City medical examiner ruled Epstein\'s death a suicide. Epstein\'s lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation. Epstein\'s brother Mark hired Michael Baden to oversee the autopsy. In late October, Baden announced that autopsy evidence was more indicative of homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. Both the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice\'s inspector general are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with conspiracy and record falsification. Due to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of his death (e.g. the removal of his cellmate without a replacement, the falling asleep of two guards who were meant to check on him, and the malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell) and Epstein\'s claimed knowledge of compromising information about famous people, his death generated doubt about his apparent suicide and speculation that he was murdered."},{"title":"Overseas Censorship of Chinese Issues","source":"Wikipedia","author":"","description":"","smmry":0,"link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_censorship_of_Chinese_issues","date":"","wikiextract":"Overseas censorship of Chinese issues refers to censorship outside the People\'s Republic of China of topics considered sensitive by the ruling Communist Party of China.
