In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson\'s wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender\'s two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military\'s purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine\'s abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays.

Rather a person\'s identity (their ego) binds them to the physical universe, creating a relationship with their environment and other people. The separation of the self and the physical world leads to the misuse of technology and the attempt to violently subjugate man\'s natural environment, leading to its destruction.Explaining man\'s role in the universe as a unique expression of the total universe, and interdependent on it, Alan Watts offers a new understanding of personal identity.

The illusion that we are isolated beings, unconnected to the rest of the universe, has led us to view the \'outside\' world with hostility, and has fueled our misuse of technology and our violent and hostile subjugation of the natural world. In The Book, philosopher Alan Watts provides us with a much-needed answer to the problem of personal identity, distilling and adapting the ancient Hindu philosophy of Vedanta to help us understand that the self is in fact the root and ground of the universe. In this mind-opening and revelatory work, Watts has crafted a primer on what it means to be human—and a manual of initiation into the central mystery of existence.","image":"books/The Book_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alan_Watts"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60551.The_Book_on_the_Taboo_Against_Knowing_Who_You_Are"},{"title":"File","link":"https://terebess.hu/english/AlanWatts-On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf"}]},{"title":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","year":"1883-1891","goodreadsRating":"4.05","ratingNew":4.06,"numRatings":101929,"numPages":327,"published":"1883","isbn":null,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480901846i/51893._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a foundational work of Western literature and is widely considered to be Friedrich Nietzsche’s masterpiece.

But how can such a mysterious abstraction be real -- or is our \'I\' merely a convenient fiction?","image":"books/I Am a Strange Loop_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":"https://books.google.com/books?id=SStFwf1H6j4C"},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming","author":"Stephen LaBerge, Howard Rheingold","year":"1989","goodreadsRating":"4.22","ratingNew":4.21,"numRatings":2569,"numPages":335,"published":"September 19th 1989","isbn":9780345374103,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320559467i/316781._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":"\\"[A] solid how-to book...For amateur dream researchers, this is a must\\" WHOLE EARTH REVIEWThis book goes far beyond the confines of pop dream psychology, establishing a scientifically researched framework for using lucid dreaming--that is, consciously influencing the outcome of your dreams.

To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps.

Crime goes down. The prison population doubles.\\"\\"Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world\'s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail.\\"  In search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends--growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration--come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime--but it\'s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side.  In \\"The Divide, \\"Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice--the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights.  Through astonishing--and enraging--accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide\'s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all.

The stunning rise, fall, and rescue of Wall Street in the bubble-and-bailout era was the coming-out party for the network of looters who sit at the nexus of American political and economic power. The grifter class—made up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their bidding—has been growing in power for a generation, transferring wealth upward through increasingly complex financial mechanisms and political maneuvers. The crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how they’ve hijacked America’s political and economic life.Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi here unravels the whole fiendish story, digging beyond the headlines to get into the deeper roots and wider implications of the rise of the grifters. He traces the movement’s origins to the cult of Ayn Rand and her most influential—and possibly weirdest—acolyte, Alan Greenspan, and offers fresh reporting on the backroom deals that decided the winners and losers in the government bailouts. He uncovers the hidden commodities bubble that transferred billions of dollars to Wall Street while creating food shortages around the world, and he shows how finance dominates politics, from the story of investment bankers auctioning off America’s infrastructure to an inside account of the high-stakes battle for health-care reform—a battle the true reformers lost. Finally, he tells the story of Goldman Sachs, the “vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.”  Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing, and scathingly funny account yet written of the ongoing political and financial crisis in America.

Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications. These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media’s handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.","categories":["Politics","Nonfiction","History","Philosophy","Sociology","Economics","Journalism","Political Science","Society","Psychology"],"plot":"In this pathbreaking work Edward S.

What are the ten principles of concentration of wealth and power at work in America today? They\'re simple enough: reduce democracy, shape ideology, redesign the economy, shift the burden onto the poor and middle classes, attack the solidarity of the people, let special interests run the regulators, engineer election results, use fear and the power of the state to keep the rabble in line, manufacture consent, marginalize the population. In Requiem for the American Dream, Chomsky devotes a chapter to each of these ten principles, and adds readings from some of the core texts that have influenced his thinking to bolster his argument.To create Requiem for the American Dream, Chomsky and his editors, the filmmakers Peter Hutchison, Kelly Nyks, and Jared P. Scott, spent countless hours together over the course of five years, from 2011 to 2016. After the release of the film version, Chomsky and the editors returned to the many hours of tape and transcript and created a document that included three times as much text as was used in the film. The book that has resulted is nonetheless arguably the most succinct and tightly woven of Chomsky\'s long career, a beautiful vessel--including old-fashioned ligatures in the typeface--in which to carry Chomsky\'s bold and uncompromising vision, his perspective on the economic reality and its impact on our political and moral well-being as a nation.\\"During the Great Depression, which I\'m old enough to remember, it was bad–much worse subjectively than today.

He puts forth his thesis with a rhetorical style that is passionate, logical, and laden with examples and illustrations.” ForeWord Magazine“Weapons of Mass Instruction is probably his best yet. Gatto’s storytelling skill shines as he relates tales of real people who fled the school system and succeeded in spite of the popular wisdom that insists on diplomas, degrees and credentials. If you are just beginning to suspect there may be a problem with schooling (as opposed to educating as Gatto would say), then you’ll not likely find a better expose of the problem than Weapons of Mass Instruction.” Cathy Duffy Reviews\\"In this book, the noisy gadfly of U.S. education takes up the question of damage done in the name of schooling. Again he touches on many of the same questions and finds the same answers.  Gatto is a bold and compelling critic in a field defined by politic statements, and from the first pages of this book he takes even unwilling readers along with him. In Weapons of Mass Instruction, he speaks movingly to readers\' deepest desires for an education that taps their talents and frees frustrated ambitions. It is a challenging and extraordinary book that is a must read for anyone navigating their way through the school system.\\" - Ria Julien - Winnipeg Free PressJohn Taylor Gatto’s Weapons of Mass Instruction focuses on mechanisms of familiar schooling that cripple imagination, discourage critical thinking, and create a false view of learning as a by-product of rote-memorization drills. Gatto’s earlier book, Dumbing Us Down, put that now-famous expression of the title into common use worldwide. Weapons of Mass Instruction promises to add another chilling metaphor to the brief against schooling.Here is a demonstration that the harm school inflicts is quite rational and deliberate, following high-level political theories constructed by Plato, Calvin, Spinoza, Fichte, Darwin, Wundt, and others, which contend the term “education” is meaningless because humanity is strictly limited by necessities of biology, psychology, and theology. The real function of pedagogy is to render the common population manageable.Realizing that goal demands that the young be conditioned to rely upon experts, remain divided from natural alliances, and accept disconnections from the experiences that create self-reliance and independence.Escaping this trap requires a different way of growing up, one Gatto calls “open source learning.” In chapters such as “A Letter to Kristina, my Granddaughter”; “Fat Stanley”; and “Walkabout:London,” this different reality is illustrated.John Taylor Gatto taught for thirty years in public schools before resigning from school-teaching in the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal during the year he was named New York State’s official Teacher of the Year. Since then, he has traveled three million miles lecturing on school reform.","categories":["Education","Nonfiction","Politics","History","Teaching","Sociology","Parenting","Philosophy","Psychology","School"],"plot":"Focuses on mechanisms of familiar schooling that cripple imagination, discourage critical thinking, and create a false view of learning as a by-product of rote-memorization drills.

These three Great Untruths are part of a larger philosophy that sees young people as fragile creatures who must be protected and supervised by adults. But despite the good intentions of the adults who impart them, the Great Untruths are harming kids by teaching them the opposite of ancient wisdom and the opposite of modern psychological findings on grit, growth, and antifragility. The result is rising rates of depression and anxiety, along with endless stories of college campuses torn apart by moralistic divisions and mutual recriminations. This is a book about how we got here. First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt take us on a tour of the social trends stretching back to the 1980s that have produced the confusion and conflict on campus today, including the loss of unsupervised play time and the birth of social media, all during a time of rising political polarization.  This is a book about how to fix the mess. The culture of “safety” and its intolerance of opposing viewpoints has left many young people anxious and unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for their parents, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for a democracy that is already pushed to the brink of violence over its growing political divisions. Lukianoff and Haidt offer a comprehensive set of reforms that will strengthen young people and institutions, allowing us all to reap the benefits of diversity, including viewpoint diversity.

Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, and self-defense.","image":"books/The Laws of Human Nature_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":""},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Human_Nature.html?id=I_1RDwAAQBAJ"},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39330937-the-laws-of-human-nature"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties","author":"Tom O\'Neill","year":"2019","goodreadsRating":"3.93","ratingNew":3.93,"rating":3.93,"plot":"A journalist\'s twenty-year fascination with the Manson murders leads to shocking new revelations about the FBI\'s involvement in this riveting reassessment of an infamous case in American history.

Over two grim nights in Los Angeles, the young followers of Charles Manson murdered seven people, including the actress Sharon Tate, then eight months pregnant. With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader\'s every order-their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the sixties. Manson became one of history\'s most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia-or dystopia-was just an acid trip away. Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O\'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the \\"official\\" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi-prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of Helter Skelter-turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O\'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions:Who were Manson\'s real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties?Why didn\'t law enforcement, including Manson\'s own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him?And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers?O\'Neill\'s quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco\'s summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA\'s mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders.

Moving away from the Marxist/Freudian approaches that had concerned him earlier, Baudrillard developed in this book a theory of contemporary culture that relies on displacing economic notions of cultural production with notions of cultural expenditure.Baudrillard uses the concepts of the simulacra—the copy without an original—and simulation. These terms are crucial to an understanding of the postmodern, to the extent that they address the concept of mass reproduction and reproduceability that characterizes our electronic media culture.Baudrillard\'s book represents a unique and original effort to rethink cultural theory from the perspective of a new concept of cultural materialism, one that radically redefines postmodern formulations of the body.Sheila Glaser is an editor at Artforum magazine.","categories":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Theory","Sociology"],"links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":""},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":""},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":""},{"title":"Wikisource","link":""},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22613.Simulacra_and_Simulation"},{"title":"File","link":"https://www.e-reading-lib.com/bookreader.php/144970/jean-baudrillard-simulacra-and-simulation.pdf"}]},{"title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","author":"David Hume","year":"1748","goodreadsRating":"3.91","ratingNew":3.92,"numRatings":16266,"numPagesActual":96,"publishedActual":"1748","isbn":9781420926996,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348617665i/130119._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":null,"categories":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Classics","Psychology","Science","18th Century","School","Academic","College","Religion"],"plot":"Discusses the weakness that humans have in their abilities to comprehend the world around them, what is referred to in the title as human understanding.","image":"books/An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_sm.jpg","links":[{"title":"Wiki","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding"},{"title":"TvTropes","link":""},{"title":"Cliffsnotes","link":""},{"title":"Sparknotes","link":"http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/understanding/"},{"title":"Litcharts","link":""},{"title":"Gutenberg","link":"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"},{"title":"Gitenberg","link":"https://github.com/GITenberg/An-Enquiry-Concerning-Human-Understanding_9662"},{"title":"Wikisource","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding"},{"title":"Google","link":""},{"title":"Goodreads","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130119.An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding"},{"title":"File","link":""}]},{"title":"Two Treatises of Government","author":"John Locke","year":"1689","goodreadsRating":"3.82","ratingNew":3.84,"numRatings":16349,"numPagesActual":480,"publishedActual":"1689","isbn":9780521357302,"goodreadsImage":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348664298i/364550._UY630_SR1200,630_.jpg","goodreadsPlot":null,"categories":["Philosophy","Politics","Nonfiction","Classics","History"],"plot":"A work of political philosophy.

In his sweeping account of humanity\'s social and political development, the author develops a theory of human evolution that prefigures Darwinian thought and encompasses aspects of ethics, sociology, and epistemology.

This effort, however, quickly turned into a discredited enterprise involving recreational drug use. But what if a study of psychedelics was undertaken with trusted scientific rigor? William A. Richards does just that in Sacred Knowledge, the first well-documented, sophisticated account of the effect of psychedelics on biological processes, human consciousness, and revelatory religious experiences. Richards argues that, if used responsibly and legally, psychedelics have incredible potential to assuage human suffering and constructively contribute to the quality of life on our planet. His work is based on nearly three decades of legal research with volunteers aged twenty-four to eighty-one.Sacred Knowledge enriches humanities and scientific scholarship, expanding work in philosophy, anthropology, theology, and religious studies, as well as in mental health, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology. Richards\'s analysis also contributes to social and political debates over the responsible integration of psychedelic substances into modern society. His book is an invaluable resource for readers who, whether spontaneously or with the facilitation of psychedelics, have encountered meaningful, inspiring, or even disturbing states of consciousness and seek clarity about their experiences. Testing the limits of language and conceptual frameworks, Richards makes the most of experiential phenomena that stretch our concepts of reality and advances new frontiers in the study of belief, spiritual awakening, psychiatric treatment, and social well-being.","categories":["Psychology","Spirituality","Nonfiction","Science","Religion","Philosophy"],"plot":"In the early 1960s, scientists openly advocated for experimentation with psychedelics.

In this guide to the immediate and long-term effects of psychedelic use for spiritual (high dose), therapeutic (moderate dose), and problem-solving (low dose) purposes, Fadiman outlines best practices for safe, sacred entheogenic voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention.Fadiman reviews the newest as well as the neglected research into the psychotherapeutic value of visionary drug use for increased personal awareness and a host of serious medical conditions, including his recent study of the reasons for and results of psychedelic use among hundreds of students and professionals. He reveals new uses for LSD and other psychedelics, including extremely low doses for improved cognitive functioning and emotional balance. Cautioning that psychedelics are not for everyone, he dispels the myths and misperceptions about psychedelics circulating in textbooks and clinics as well as on the internet. Exploring the life-changing experiences of Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Aldous Huxley, and Huston Smith as well as Francis Crick and Steve Jobs, Fadiman shows how psychedelics, used wisely, can lead not only to healing but also to scientific breakthroughs and spiritual epiphanies.","categories":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Science","Spirituality","Philosophy"],"plot":"James Fadiman has been involved with psychedelic research since the 1960s.

Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.\\n\\nAnd after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.

While we tried to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day: large animals seem to be immune to cancer. Which doesn’t make any sense – the bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled.\\nThis led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.\\nBut the big picture conceals  the details.\\n\\nLet us look at one region in particular:\\nSub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.\\nWhile some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100.\\nSuch growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.\\nSo is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed?

Although freedom was breaking out all over, many of the societies that were touting these ideas relied on slave labor. Few places in the world relied so heavily on slave labor as Saint-Domingue, France\'s most profitable colony. Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue\'s population, and in 1789 they couldn\'t help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled. This led to not one but two revolutions, and ended up with France, the rebels, Britain, and Spain all fighting in the territory. Spoiler alert: the slaves won. So how did the slaves of what would become Haiti throw off the yoke of one of the world\'s great empires?

At the beginning of the 1800s, Latin America was firmly under the control of Spain and Portugal. The revolutionary zeal that had recently created the United States and had taken off Louis XVI\'s head in France arrived in South America, and a racially diverse group of people who felt more South American than European took over. John covers the soft revolution of Brazil, in which Prince Pedro boldly seized power from his father, but promised to give it back if King João ever returned to Brazil. He also covers the decidedly more violent revolutions in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina.

European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the \\"sun never set on the British Empire.\\" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests.

John will teach you how the assassination of an Austrian Archduke kicked off a new kind of war that involved more nations and more people than any war that came before. New technology like machine guns, airplanes, tanks, and poison gas made the killing more efficient than ever. Trench warfare and modern weapons led to battles in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed in a day, with no ground gained for either side. World War I washed away the last vestiges of 19th century Romanticism and paved the way for the 20th century modernism that we all know and find to be cold and off-putting.

While the rest of the world was off having a couple of World Wars, China was busily uprooting the dynastic system that had ruled there for millennia. Most revolutions have some degree of tumult associated with them, but China\'s 20th century revolutions were REALLY disruptive. In 1911 and 1912, Chinese nationalists brought 3000 years of dynastic rule to an end. China plunged into chaos as warlords staked out regions of the country for themselves. The nationalists and communists joined forces briefly to bring the nation back together under the Chinese Republic, and then they quickly split and started fighting the Chinese Civil War. The fight between nationalists and communists went on for decades, and was interrupted by an alliance to fight the invading  Japanese during World War II. After the World War II ended, the Chinese Civil War was back on. Mao and the communists were ultimately victorious, and Chiang Kai-Shek ended up in Taiwan. And then it got weird. Mao spent years repeatedly trying to purify the Communist Party and build up the new People\'s Republic of China with Rectifications, Anti Campaigns, Five Year Plans. the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution. These had mixed results, to say the least.

We\'ve all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves.

In the sense of its temperature. It was by no means cool, man.  After World War II, there were basically two big geopolitical powers left to divide up the world. And divide they did. The United States and the Soviet Union divvied up Europe in the aftermath of the war, and then proceeded to spend the next 45 years fighting over the rest of the world. It was the great ideological struggle, with the US on the side of capitalism and profit, and the USSR pushing Communism, so-called. While both sides presented themselves as the good guy in this situation, the reality is that there are no good guys. Both parties to the Cold War engaged in forcible regime changes, built up vast nuclear arsenals, and basically got up to dirty tricks.

The railroad changed human perception of time and space, making long distance travel much faster and easier. Railroads also changed habits, including increasing reading. People needed some sort of distraction to ensure they didn\'t have to talk to other people on the train. Like any new technology, railroads also scared people. All kinds of fears surrounded rail travel, but over time, people got over them.

Charles Hapsburg was the holy Roman Emperor, but he was also the King of Spain. And the King of Germany. And the King of Italy and the Lord of the Netherlands and Count Palatine of Burgundy. In short, Charles was runnin\' thangs in much of the world during his reign. Charles ruled a lot of countries, and he was also known for encouraging intellectual discourse and he even spoke out against slavery, in a limited. So why did he consider himself a failure, and why did he break up the Empire when he abdicated in 1556? Mainly because the Holy Roman Empire didn\'t work very well. It was huge, and it didn\'t have any means of directly raising taxes. Plus, it was a pretty crazy time in Europe anyway, and Charles found himself in charge of the Catholic-Church-Endorsed Empire in the time of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. John will teach you a bit about how Charles put the Empire together, and how it fell apart, and even talk a bit about the Diet of Worms.\\n\\nThis episode was written by Neal Schulz, but we messed up the onscreen credits.

There was a flourishing of art and literature in the period, and a lot of that culture was created by women.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve is the organization that steps in to use monetary policy to steer the economy. When the Fed, as it\'s called, does step in, there are a few different tacks it can take. The Fed can change interest rates, or it can change the money supply.

Before you laugh, just remember, you COULD be in charge of an economy someday. Someone has to do it, and anyway, if it could happen to Alan Greenspan, it could happen to you, too. The first thing you\'re going to want to avoid is hyperinflation. Don\'t print too much money, okay? Actually, it\'s a little more complicated than that. Jacob and Adriene will explain. You\'re also going to want to stay away from recessions, and especially depressions. In the world as it exists today, continued growth is the only path to viability. While some argue for sustainability or even controlled recession, you\'re not going to keep a job as head of central bank thinking like that in this day and age. Also, avoid stagflation, which is a stagnant, no-growth economy combined with inflation. It\'s just the worst. Don\'t do it.

Free trade and globalization tend to provide an overall benefit, and raises average incomes across the globe. The downside is that it isn\'t good for every individual in the system. In some countries, manufacturing jobs move to places where labor costs are lower. And some countries that receive the influx of jobs aren\'t prepared to deal with it, from a regulatory standpoint.

But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we\'re mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn\'t get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.\\n\\nTurn on the captions.

What were the English doing in America, anyway? Lots of stuff. In Virginia, the colonists were largely there to make money. In Maryland, the idea was to create a a colony for Catholics who wanted to be serfs of the Lords Baltimore. In Massachusetts, the Pilgrims and Puritans came to America to find a place where they could freely persecute those who didn\'t share their beliefs. But there was a healthy profit motive in Massachusetts as well. Profits were thin at first, and so were the colonists. Trouble growing food and trouble with the natives kept the early colonies from success. Before long though, the colonists started cultivating tobacco, which was a win for everyone involved if you ignore the lung cancer angle.

Old New York was once New Amsterdam. Why they changed it, I can say; ENGLISH people just liked it better that way, and when the English took New Amsterdam in 1643, that\'s just what they did. Before the English got there though, the colony was full of Dutch people  who treated women pretty fairly, and allowed free black people to hold jobs. John also discusses Penn\'s Woods, also known as Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was (briefly) a haven of religious freedom, and William Penn dealt relatively fairly with the natives his colony displaced. Of course, as soon as Penn died, the colonist started abusing the natives immediately. We venture as far south as the Carolina colonies, where the slave labor economy was taking shape. John also takes on the idea of the classless society in America, and the beginning of the idea of the American dream. It turns out that in spite of the lofty dream that everyone had an equal shot in the new world, there were elites in the colonies. And these elites tended to be in charge. And then their kids tended to take over when they died. So yeah, not quite an egalitarian paradise. In addition to all this, we get into the Salem Witch Trials, the treatment of women in the colonies, and colonial economics.

Confusing? Maybe. John argues that the Seven Years War, which is often called the French and Indian War in the US, laid a lot of the groundwork for the Revolution. More confusing? Why does this war have two names? Why were the French and Indians fighting each other? The Seven Years war was actually a global war that went on for nine years. I think I\'m having trouble making this clear. Anyway, the part of this global war that happened in North America was the French and Indian War. The French and Indian tribes were the force opposing the British, so that\'s the name that stuck. Let\'s get away from this war, as it makes my head hurt. Other stuff was going on in the colonies in the 18th century that primed the people for revolution. One was the Great Awakening. Religious revival was sweeping the country, introducing new ideas about religion and how it should be practiced. At the same time thinkers like John Locke were rethinking the relationship between rulers and the ruled. So in this highly charged atmosphere, you can just imagine what would happen if the crown started trying to exert more control over the colonies. The colonists would probably just rise up, right?

We\'ll start with the end of the Seven Years War, and the bill that the British ran up fighting the war. This led to taxes on colonial trade, which led to colonists demanding representation, which led to revolution. It all seems very complicated, but Crash Course will get you through it in about 12 minutes.\\n\\nTurn on the captions.

Everyone is familiar with how this war played out for the Founding Fathers; they got to become the Founding Fathers. But what did the revolution mean to the common people in the United States? For white, property-owning males, it was pretty sweet. They gained rights that were a definite step up from being British Colonial citizens. For everyone else, the short-term gains were not clear. Women\'s rights were unaffected, and slaves remained in slavery. As for poor white folks, they remained poor and disenfranchised.

In the beginning, soon after the US constitution was adopted, politics were pretty non-existent. George Washington was elected president with no opposition, everything was new and exciting, and everyone just got along. For several months. Then the contentious debate about the nature of the United States began, and it continues to this day. Washington and his lackey/handler Alexander Hamilton pursued an elitist program of federalism. They attempted to strengthen the central government, create a strong nation-state, and leave less of the governance to the states, They wanted to create debt, encourage manufacturing, and really modernize the new nation/ The opposition, creatively known as the anti-federalists, wanted to build some kind of agrarian pseudo-paradise where every (white) man could have his own farm, and live a free, self-reliant life. The founding father who epitomized this view was Thomas Jefferson. By the time Adams became president, the anti-federalists had gotten the memo about how alienating a name like anti-federalist can be. It\'s so much more appealing to voters if your party is for something rather than being defined by what you\'re against, you know? In any case, Jefferson and his acolytes changed their name to the Democratic-Republican Party, which covered a lot of bases, and proceeded to protest nearly everything Adams did. Lest you think this week is all boring politics,you\'ll be thrilled to hear this episode has a Whiskey Rebellion, a Quasi-War, anti-French sentiment, some controversial treaties, and something called the XYZ Affair, which sounds very exciting.

Jefferson is a somewhat controversial figure in American history, largely because he, like pretty much all humans, was a big bundle of contradictions. Jefferson was a slave-owner who couldn\'t decide if he liked slavery. He advocated for small government, but expanded federal power more than either of his presidential predecessor. He also idealized the independent farmer and demonized manufacturing, but put policies in place that would expand industrial production in the US. Controversy may ensue as we try to deviate a bit from the standard hagiography/slander story that usually told about old TJ. John explores Jefferson\'s election, his policies, and some of the new nation\'s (literally and figuratively) formative events that took place during Jefferson\'s presidency.

In the first half of the 19th century, the way people lived and worked in the United States changed drastically. At play was the classic (if anything in a 30 year old nation can be called classic) American struggle between the Jeffersonian ideal of individuals sustaining themselves on small farms vs. the Hamiltonian vision of an economy based on manufacturing and trade. I\'ll give you one guess who won. Too late! It was Hamilton, which is why if you live in the United States, you probably live in a city, and are unlikely to be a farmer. Please resist the urge to comment about this if you live in the country and/or are a farmer. Your anecdotal experience doesn\'t change the fact that most people live in cities. In the early 19th century, new technologies in transportation and communication helped remake the economic system of the country. Railroads and telegraphs changed the way people moved goods and information around. The long and short of it is, the Market Revolution meant that people now went somewhere to work rather than working at home. Often, that somewhere was a factory where they worked for an hourly wage rather than getting paid for the volume of goods they manufactured. This shift in the way people work has repercussions in our daily lives right down to today.

Once Jackson was in office, he did more to expand executive power than any of the previous occupants of the White House.

The North\'s industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn\'t get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant\'s plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South.

Immigrants flocked to the US from all over the world in this time period. Millions of Europeans moved to the US where they drove the growth of cities and manned the rapid industrialization that was taking place. In the western US many, many Chinese immigrants arrived to work on the railroad and in mines. As is often the case in the United States, the people who already lived in the US reacted kind of badly to this flood of immigrants. Some legislators tried to stem the flow of new arrivals, with mixed success. Grover Cleveland vetoed a general ban on immigration, but the leadership at the time did manage to get together to pass and anti-Chinese immigration law. Immigrants did win some important Supreme Court decisions upholding their rights, but in many ways, immigrants were treated as second class citizens. At the same time, the country was rapidly urbanizing. Cities were growing rapidly and industrial technology was developing new wonders all the time.

What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, \\"The Gilded Age.\\" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement. The Populists, who threw in their lot with William Jennings Bryan, never managed to get it together and win a presidency, and they faded after 1896.

In the late 19th and early 20th century in America, there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result, we got the Progressive Era, which has very little to do with automobile insurance, but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age, and is a little confusing, but here we have it. Basically, people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify, there was a competition between the corporations\' desire to keep wages low and workers\' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety, reducing child labor, and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made, and people were becoming more free, these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south, and immigrant rights were restricted as well.

The US saw that Spain\'s hold on its empire was weak, and like some kind of expansionist predator, it jumped into the Cuban War for Independence and turned it into the Spanish-Cuban-Phillipino-American War, which usually just gets called the Spanish-American War.

They didn\'t know there was going to be a second one, though they probably should have guessed, \'cause this one didn\'t wrap up very neatly. So, the United States stayed out of World War I at first, because Americans were in an isolationist mood in the early 20th century. That didn\'t last though, as the affronts piled up and drew the US into the war. Spoiler alert: the Lusitania was sunk two years before we joined the war, so that wasn\'t the sole cause for our jumping in. It was part of it though, as was the Zimmerman telegram, unrestricted submarine warfare, and our affinity for the Brits. You\'ll learn the war\'s effects on the home front, some of Woodrow Wilson\'s XIV Points, and just how the war ended up expanding the power of the government in Americans\' lives.\\n\\nSubbable message!!!: Jared Richardson says, \\"All true love is beautiful.

So the big deal is, of course, the right to vote women gained when the 19th amendment was passed and ratified. But women made a lot of other gains in the 30 years between 1890 and 1920. More women joined the workforce, they acquired lots of other legal rights related to property, and they also became key consumers in the industrial economy. Women also continued to play a vital role in reform movements. Sadly, they got Prohibition enacted in the US, but they did a lot of good stuff, too. The field of social work emerged as women like Jane Addams created settlement houses to assist immigrants in their integration into the United States. Women also began to work to make birth control widely available. You\'ll learn about famous reformers and activists like Alice Paul, Margaret Sanger, and Emma Goldman, among others.\\n\\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit\'s free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn\'t lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren.

So, the sixties are often remembered for the liberal changes that the decade brought to America, but lest you forget, Richard Nixon was elected to the presidency during the sixties. The conservative movement didn\'t start with Nixon though. Modern conservatism really entered mainstream consciousness during the 1964 presidential contest between incumbent president and Kennedy torch-bearer Lyndon B Johnson, and Republican senator Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater never had a shot in the election, he used the campaign to talk about all kinds of conservative ideas. At the same time, several varying groups, including libertarian conservatives and moral conservatives, began to work together.

A sort of perfect storm of events, it combined the continuing decline of America\'s manufacturing base and the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, and brought about an stagnant economy, paired with high inflation. Economists with a flair for neologisms and portamenteau words called this \\"stagflation,\\" and it made people miserable. Two presidential administrations were scuttled at least in part by these economic woes; both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter are considered failed presidents for many reasons, but largely because of an inability to improve the economy. (hint: In reality, no one person can materially change something as big as the world economy, even if they are president, but one person sure can make a handy scapegoat!) So, by and large, the 70s were a pretty terrible time in America economically, but at least the decade gave us Mr. Green.\\n\\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD!

Bush. It was neither the best of times, nor the worst of times. On the domestic front, the first president Bush inherited the relative prosperity of the later Reagan years, and watched that prosperity evaporate. That was about all the interest Bush 41 had, domestically, so let\'s move to foreign policy, which was a bigger deal at this time. The biggie was the end of the Cold War, which is the title of the video, so you know it\'s important. The collapse of the Soviet Union was the biggest deal of Bush\'s term, and history has assigned the credit to Ronald Reagan. We give the guy a break, and say that he helped. He was certainly expert in foreign policy, having been and envoy to China, ambassador to the United Nations,  and head of the CIA. Bush also oversaw the first Gulf War, which was something of a success, in that the primary mission was accomplished, and the vast majority of the troops were home in short order. It didn\'t do much to address some of the other problems in the region, but we\'ll get to that in the next few weeks.

You\'ll remember from last week that the old-school Republican George H.W. Bush had lost the 1992 presidential election to a young upstart Democrat from Arkansas named Bill Clinton. Clinton was a bit of a dark horse candidate, having survived a sex scandal during the election, but a third party run by Ross Perot split the vote, and Clinton was inaugurated in 1993. John will teach you about Clinton\'s foreign policy agenda, which included NATO action in the Balkans and the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO. He\'ll also cover some of the domestic successes and failures of the Clinton years, including the failed attempt at healthcare reform, the pretty terrible record on GLBTQ issues, Welfare reform, which got mixed reviews, and the happier issues like the huge improvements in the economy.

Judicial restraint is often equated with conservatism, but as we’ll show you, this is not always the case. \\n\\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\\n\\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\\n\\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\\n\\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\\n\\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\\n\\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids","keywords":["John Green","Hank Green","vlogbrothers","Crash Course","crashcourse","craig benzine","crash course government","us politics","civics","government and politics","judicial restraint","judicial activism","king v burwell","obergefell v hodges","affordable care act","lovewins","John Roberts (Judge)","Clarence Thomas (Judge)","Antonin Scalia (Judge)","Anthony Kennedy","Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Judge)","Samuel Alito","Elena Kagan (Judge)","Sonia Soto","Stephen Breyer (Judge)","same-sex marriage"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjLcLguoKC4"},{"title":"23 - Civil Rights & Liberties","image":"yt/kbwsF-A2sTg_sm.jpg","date":"Jul 17, 2015","full_title":"Civil Rights & Liberties: Crash Course Government #23","views":826815,"likes":null,"dislikes":null,"rating":4.8693442,"length_seconds":476,"published":1437091200000,"description":"Today, Craig is going to give you an overview of civil rights and civil liberties.

But even with all these rage-inducing and bizarre district maps, it\'s important to remember that it isn\'t ALL political scheming, but also a reflection of the tendency for Democrats to live in urban areas. \\n\\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\\n\\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\\n\\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\\n\\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids","keywords":["John Green","Hank Green","vlogbrothers","Crash Course","crashcourse","us government","government and politics","craig benzine","wheezy waiter","gerrymandering","electoral college","elections","apportionment","single member districts","contiguous","redistricting","at large elections","equal representation","elbridge gerry","senate","house of representatives","congress","state legislatures"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnhFm5QVVTo"},{"title":"38 - How Voters Decide","image":"yt/eermkiaFoWc_sm.jpg","date":"Nov 13, 2015","full_title":"How Voters Decide: Crash Course Government and Politics #38","views":346461,"likes":3828,"dislikes":80,"rating":4.9181166,"length_seconds":455,"published":1447372800000,"description":"So today, Craig is going to try to get inside the heads of voters by discussing how voters make decisions.

There have been five, arguably six, party systems since the election of John Adams in 1796 (George Washington’s presidency was an unusual case, and we’ll get to that), so we’ll look at the supporters and policies of each of the parties during these eras and look at how historical contingencies cause these policy shifts.

This question lies at the heart of The Prestige, Christopher Nolan’s 2006 movie about two warring magicians, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who risk everything to become the master of their craft. Like a talented illusionist himself, Nolan blurs the line between appearance and reality until we, the viewer, begin to question our own understanding of identity. Is it based on a soul or some immutable essence? Or do we only become ourselves through the roles we play? Here’s our Take on how Nolan explores this theme in The Prestige, as well his other films like Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception—and how this may be The Prestige’s most impressive reveal.

The magazine has quickly become a highly respected outlet for open discussion of topics in psychology and the social and behavioral sciences. \\n\\nClaire was studying forensic psychology at the graduate level but decided that she could contribute more to the general scientific discussion as a journalist. Hence her decision to found Quillette. In this discussion, she describes the founding, development and monetization strategy underpinning her journalistic work. From Wikipedia: “The website drew significant public attention on August 7, 2017 after publishing the responses of four scientists (Lee Jussim, David P. Schmitt, Geoffrey Miller, and Debra W. Soh) to James Damore\'s controversial memo \\"Google\'s Ideological Echo Chamber\\". The website was temporarily shut down by a DDoS attack following publication of the piece.”\\n\\nClaire stated, during our discussion: “I didn’t think that any standard journalistic outlet would publish the material, scientific or otherwise, that I considered valuable and appropriate. The best places for scientific journalism won’t go near anything that contradicts very strong left-wing narratives such as the reality of stereotype threat (a literature severely criticized in http://bit.ly/2oVINv6), the validity of intelligence research, or the existence of sex differences in personality and interest.” I provided an extensive reference list with regard to the latter in the description for my video commentary on the James Damore/Google affair: http://bit.ly/2HmfIQ6). David Schmitt’s work (summarized here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201711/the-truth-about-sex-differences) is also relevant in this regard.  \\nWe discussed the failure of psychologists to admit to, let alone identify, authoritarian tendencies on the left since the end of World War II, although there has been no shortage of work detailing those tendencies on the right. In my lab, we recently tried to rectify this with some recent as-of-yet unpublished studies making up the Master’s thesis work of my student Christine Brophy (see http://bit.ly/2eXN3m2). \\n\\nClaire and I also discussed the danger to women (particularly mothers) as a consequence of the social-constructionist denial of the biological differences between the sexes and the practical necessity of distinguishing between “women” and “mothers” in the economic discussion, the over-emphasis on career compared to family that is characteristic of modern life, the impossibility of a high-achieving career, in general (to say nothing of managing that with the demands of motherhood), and the failure of feminism to address that impossibility in a realistic and measured manner.\\nWe close with a discussion of the fraudulent and politically-motivated misuse of the concept of implicit bias and the lack of evidence for success for anti-unconscious bias retraining programs, and consideration of the differences in competition strategies between males and females in the workplace and more broadly. \\n\\nOne of Quillette’s early successes, by criminologists Brian Boutwell: http://quillette.com/2015/11/13/criminologists-who-study-bio-shunned-by-field/\\n\\nOn the false dichotomy between sex and gender: http://quillette.com/2018/02/07/real-gender-trouble/\\nAnd, in closing, on female preference for male bosses: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/549818/women-prefer-male-bosses/\\n\\nOnce again, please consider supporting Quillette’s fine work through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Quillette/overview\\n\\nAdditional relevant links:\\n\\nWebsite: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n\\n \\n\\nBooks:\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/10/great-books/\\n\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: Dates, Cities and Venues: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\n\\nSelf Authoring Suite: http://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: http://understandmyself.com/\\n\\n \\n\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\nSupport this channel: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate","keywords":["Jordan Peterson","Jordan B Peterson","psychology","psychoanalysis","Jung","existentialism","lecture","philosophy","free speech","social justice","personality","left wing","right wing","12 rules for life","google memo","jordanbpeterson","maps of meaning","Quillette","claire lehmann"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs72-WqmwI"},{"title":"The Perilous State of the University: Jonathan Haidt & Jordan B Peterson","image":"yt/4IBegL_V6AA_sm.jpg","date":"Nov 16, 2017","full_title":"The Perilous State of the University: Jonathan Haidt & Jordan B Peterson","views":650621,"likes":17400,"dislikes":321,"rating":4.9275436,"length_seconds":5694,"published":1510790400000,"description":"I recently traveled to New York University to talk with Dr. Jonathan Haidt about, among other things, disgust, purity, fear and belief; the perilous state of the modern university; and his work with Heterodox Academy (https://heterodoxacademy.org/) an organization designed to draw attention to the lack of diversity of political belief in the humanities and the social sciences.\\n\\nDr. Haidt is Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University\'s Stern School of Business and a social psychologist.

Intersectionality is a movement based on the observation that the standard identity groups (race and gender, for example) don\'t sufficiently capture the variability in oppression that characterizes those who fit into both categories simultaneously (say, black woman). I realized that the intersection of six or more categories of variation (depending on the degree of differentiation) would produce \\"groups\\" of only one individual. In that manner, the idea of the individual is necessarily making its comeback in the ideologies of collectivism that characterize so much modern thinking. It\'s an inversion, an indication of our upside down world. Many more ideas came along with that one, some associated with the idea of categorization and the ideal (in a religious and symbolic sense). I decided to contact Jonathan Pageau, who is the embodied intersection of French Canadian, artist, orthodox icon carver, male, expert on postmodernism, and bearded, as I couldn\'t easily think of anyone else to talk to about such things.\\n\\nI didn\'t edit it at all....\\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["atheist","bible","christ","christian","christianity","existentialism","faith","free speech","god","jesus","jordan peterson","lecture","philosophy","psychoanalysis","psychology","religion","spirit","truth","university of toronto","discrimination","diversity","equality","equity","feminism","freedom","inclusiveness","inclusivity","jordan b peterson","left wing","misogyny","pc","personality","polarization","political correctness","politics","right wing","sjw","social justice","social justice warrior"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F4oOlAK8w"},{"title":"Identity politics and the Marxist lie of white privilege","image":"yt/PfH8IG7Awk0_sm.jpg","date":"Nov 13, 2017","full_title":"Identity politics and the Marxist lie of white privilege","views":3823581,"likes":73945,"dislikes":3314,"rating":4.8284211,"length_seconds":9102,"published":1510531200000,"description":"I was in Vancouver Friday November 3rd talking at an event sponsored by the very active University of British Columbia Free Speech Club (start one on your campus -- if you\'re a student, that is :)).\\n\\nI wanted to delve more deeply into the ideology on the radical side of the leftist spectrum, and to specifically address the idea of white privilege.

What is belief? Why is it so important to people? Why will they fight to protect it? I propose that belief unites a culture\'s expectations and desires with the actions of its people, and that the match between those two allows for cooperative action and maintains emotional stability. I suggest, further, that culture has a deep narrative structure, presenting the world as a forum for action, with characters representing the individual, the known, and the unknown -- or the individual, culture and nature -- or the individual, order and chaos. \\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Jordan B Peterson","Archetypes","Personality","Lecture","Psychology","Psychoanalysis","Neuropsychology","Jung","Freud","Neumann","Mythology","Narrative","existentialism","peterson","jordan","atrocity","belief","jordan peterson","political correctness","university of toronto","free speech","social justice warriors"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Xc2_FtpHI"},{"title":"02: Marionettes & Individuals (Part 1)","image":"yt/EN2lyN7rM4E_sm.jpg","date":"Jan 25, 2017","full_title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 02: Marionettes & Individuals (Part 1)","views":1345324,"likes":17518,"dislikes":617,"rating":4.8639097,"length_seconds":8613,"published":1485302400000,"description":"In this lecture, I begin using a particular piece of dramatic art -- the Disney film Pinocchio -- to provide a specific example of the manner in which great mythological or archetypal themes inform and permeate narrative. \\n\\nMusic is Mozart Symphony 41: Jupiter. \\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Pinocchio","Jordan Peterson","Psychology","Maps of Meaning","Archetype","Personality","University of Toronto","Lecture","Free Speech","Neuropsychology","Psychoanalysis","Jung","C.G.

In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing on our current frame), and determine emotional significance (positive: things that move us along; negative: things that get in our way).\\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Jordan Peterson","Maps of Meaning","The Architecture of Belief","Jung","Freud","Psychoanalysis","Mythology","Psychology","Personality","University Lecture","PSY434","Religion","Christianity","Fairy Tales","Professor","jordan b peterson","narrative","existentialism","toronto","course","jordanbpeterson","lecture","jordan","university of toronto","carl jung","clinical psychology"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY"},{"title":"06: Story and Metastory (Part 2)","image":"yt/nsZ8XqHPjI4_sm.jpg","date":"Feb 20, 2017","full_title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 06: Story and Metastory (Part 2)","views":534147,"likes":7967,"dislikes":219,"rating":4.8929882,"length_seconds":8847,"published":1487548800000,"description":"In this lecture, I discuss uncertainty, or anomaly. We frame the world -- or the world reveals itself to us -- as a story, with a starting point, a destination, and the behavioral means to move from one to the other. The destination is valued more highly than the starting point, and constitutes the point of the story -- the aim of the individual. Reality manifests itself within that story as what is relevant for forward movement, what gets in the way, and what is irrelevant and can be safely ignored. The largest category, by far, is the latter. Unfortunately, sometimes what has been happily classified as irrelevant rears up and gets in the way. That\'s a manifestation of chaos. Chaos can undermine the story, or break the frame. The degree of undermining or breakage is proportional to the time and space over which the story in question extends its operations.\\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Jordan Peterson","Jordan B Peterson","Maps of Meaning","Archetypes","Psy434","Psychology","Personality","Lectures","Jung","Eliade","Joseph Cambpell","Mythology","Cybernetics","Meaning","Purpose","lecture","existentialism","university of toronto","clinical psychology","freud","psychoanalysis","jordanbpeterson","carl jung","archetype"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsZ8XqHPjI4"},{"title":"07: Images of Story & Metastory","image":"yt/F3n5qtj89QE_sm.jpg","date":"Mar 6, 2017","full_title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 07: Images of Story & Metastory","views":458188,"likes":6981,"dislikes":187,"rating":4.8956475,"length_seconds":7911,"published":1488758400000,"description":"In this lecture, I discuss how the basic or archetypal categories we use to frame the world are represented in image, where they existed long before their nature could be articulated. These categories include the individual (hero/adversary), culture (wise king/tyrant), and nature (destruction/creation). The heroic individual (the knower) is typically masculine, as is culture (the known), while the unknown is feminine. These categories can be conceptualized, as well, as explorer, explored territory, and unexplored territory. The most abstract category is the dragon of chaos, the monster who guards what is most valuable. It is from this most primordial of categories that the other three emerge. Our existence as prey and predator is reflected in the ambivalent representation of the absolute unknown.\\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Jordan Peterson","Jordan B Peterson","Maps of Meaning","The Architecture of Belief","Mythology","Psychology","Personality","Lecture","Jung","Eliade","Symbol","Psychoanalysis","Literary criticism","Existentialism","Phenomenology","course","jordanbpeterson","psy","toronto","freud","carl jung","university of toronto","clinical psychology"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3n5qtj89QE"},{"title":"08: Neuropsychology of Symbolic Representation","image":"yt/Nb5cBkbQpGY_sm.jpg","date":"Mar 13, 2017","full_title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 08: Neuropsychology of Symbolic Representation","views":583601,"likes":8290,"dislikes":360,"rating":4.8335261,"length_seconds":8481,"published":1489363200000,"description":"In this lecture, I discuss the relationship between the basic categories of imagistic/symbolic representation and brain function, noting that the very hemispheres of the brain are adapted, right/left to the environmental or experiential permanence of chaos/order or unexplored/explored territory, with consciousness serving the Logos role of communicative explorer (a function related in one of its deepest manifestations to the function of the hypothalamically grounded dopaminergic systems).\\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["Jordan B Peterson","hypothalamus","neuropsychology","Maps of Meaning","personality","psychology","lectures","course","toronto","jordanbpeterson","psy","existentialism","information","mythology","archetypes","phenomenology","the architecture of belief"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY"},{"title":"09: Patterns of Symbolic Representation","image":"yt/yXZSeiAl4PI_sm.jpg","date":"Mar 29, 2017","full_title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 09: Patterns of Symbolic Representation","views":485430,"likes":7750,"dislikes":345,"rating":4.8295245,"length_seconds":8209,"published":1490745600000,"description":"In this lecture, I discuss the manner in which the fundamental symbolic archetypes (particularly those dealing with the Wise King and Tyrant) are hijacked for the purposes of propaganda.

the year and its offerings: What is a belief system? Why are people so inclined to engage in conflict to protect their belief systems?\\n\\nIt\'s partly because our belief systems are not only systems of belief, but structures that serve to render everyone who participates in that belief and its dramatization and acting out in the world predictable, trustworthy and cooperative (even when competing). \\n\\nIs there a hierarchy of rank or value among belief systems, or are they merely arbitrary? \\n\\nWhat is the relationship between descriptions of the objective world and moral guidelines? How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?) \\n\\nWhat inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society? How is all this related to the underlying symbolic structures (religious structures) that sit at the base of our societies and belief structures? \\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","keywords":["yeshua","atheist","bible","christ","christian","christianity","existentialism","faith","free speech","god","gods","jesus","jordan peterson","lecture","openness","personality","philosophy","psychoanalysis","psychology","religion","spirit","toronto","truth","university of toronto","creativity","intelligence","iq","jordanbpeterson","psy230","social justice warrior"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V1eMvGGcXQ"}]},{"title":"Personality and Its Transformations (2017)","list":[{"title":"01: Introduction","image":"yt/kYYJlNbV1OM_sm.jpg","date":"Feb 8, 2017","full_title":"2017 Personality 01: Introduction","views":1369848,"likes":19988,"dislikes":393,"rating":4.9228692,"length_seconds":3243,"published":1486512000000,"description":"In this lecture, I define personality from multiple angles, historical, constructivist, psychoanalytic, behavioral and neuropsychological.

Conscientiousness is the (next) best predictor, particularly in the military, in school and in conservative businesses. Agreeable people make better caretakers; disagreeable people, better disciplinarians and negotiators (within reasonable bounds). Open people are artistic, creative and entrepreneurial. Extraverts are good socially. Introverts work well in isolation. People low in neuroticism have higher levels of tolerance for stress (but may be less sensitive to real signs of danger). \\n\\nMatch the career you pursue to your temperament, rather than trying to adjust the latter.

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \\n\\nCain\'s mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\\n\\nAbel\'s mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain\'s malevolence.\\n\\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel. However, it cannot be understood in its true depth without some investigation into what the motif of the flood means, psychologically, and an analysis of how that motif is informed by the order/chaos dichotomy, as well as by the idea of an involuntary voyage to the underworld or confrontation with the dragon. In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? \\n\\nAll that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.\\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

They are corrected here.\\n\\nLife at the individual and the societal level is punctuated by crisis and catastrophe. This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah “walks with God,” as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against “the righteous anger of God.” \\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Abram heeds the call to adventure, journeys courageously away from his country and family into the foreign and unknown, encounters the disasters of nature and the tyranny of mankind and maintains his relationship with the God who has sent him forth.  He becomes in this manner a light in the world, and a father of nations. \\nHow is this all to be understood? I am attempting in this lecture to determine precisely that. How are we, as modern people, to make sense of the idea of the God who reveals himself to a personality? How can we relate the details of the Abramic stories to our own lives, in the current world? In what frame of reference can these stories be seen to make sense, and to reveal their meaning? \\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Abraham\'s life is presented as a series of encapsulated narratives, punctuated by sacrifice, and the rekindling of his covenant with God. This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revaluation and reconsideration of identity, prior to the next step forward. Abraham, for his part, makes the sacrifices necessary to continue to walk with God, or before God (as the terminology in this section has it). It is this decision that allows him to transcend the vicissitudes of life, and to take his role as the father of nations. \\n\\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Successful in his encounter, he still sustains damage to his thigh, but earns the name Israel, and becomes the father of all those who to this day wrestle with God. \\n\\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Weinstein\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\nMay 22, 2018\\n\\nTomorrow is the one year anniversary of the day that 50 Evergreen students--students that I had never met--disrupted my class, accusing me of racism and demanding my resignation. I tried to reason with them. I felt no fear because I knew that, whatever my failings might be, bigotry was not among them.\\n\\nAt that moment. I felt sure I could reach these students. I also felt a moral obligation to try. Racism, which squanders human potential, and erodes human dignity, offends me. I am also well versed in the evolutionary logic that makes racism durable. I should have had no trouble establishing common ground.\\n\\nTheir response surprised me, and it would take months for me to fully understand what had happened. The protestors had no apparent interest in the very dialog they seemed to invite. I was even more surprised by the protestor\'s fervor in shouting down my actual students--some of whom had known me for years. The cruelty and derision reserved for students of color who spoke in my defense was particularly chilling.\\n\\nIf not discussion, what did they want? I was one of Evergreen\'s most popular professors. I had Evergreen\'s version of tenure. Did they really think they could force my resignation based on a meritless accusation?\\n\\nThey did think that. And they were right. What I had not counted on was their alliance with Evergreen\'s new president.\\n\\nThough the protestors openly humiliated him, the president of the college partnered with the mob in private, handing them concession after concession. We know this because the rioters filmed everything and proudly uploaded it. In one particularly telling video, President Bridges calmly discusses with the leaders of the protest a demand to target STEM faculty based on the empty assertion that scientists are particularly prone to bias. In that same video the president speaks of his plan for those who resist the new order: \\"Bring \'em in. Train \'em. And if they don\'t get it, sanction \'em.\\" He invites his partners to hold him to it.\\n\\nOn the second day of unrest, the police chief called me. Rioters were stopping traffic and searching for someone, car to car. The chief believed it was me. She was worried for my safety and helpless to protect me as the president had ordered her force to \\"stand down.\\" What would have transpired if the rioters had found me? I still don\'t know, and I strongly suspect they don\'t either.\\n\\nThe protest at my class did not emerge out of the blue in May, 2017. One year earlier I stood up and spoke in opposition to a dangerous proposal, one that threatened to establish a racial hierarchy amongst faculty.\\n\\nTo those who have not faced something similar, this likely sounds hyperbolic. But one can now advance such policies, and almost certainly succeed in passing them, if they are properly draped in weaponized terminology. \\"Equity\\", for example, has taken on special properties. If a person opposes an \\"equity\\" proposal, those advancing the proposal are secure in asserting that their opponent is motivated by opposition to racial equity itself: In other words, that they are racist.\\n\\nMy opposition to that first \\"equity\\" proposal was voiced to my colleagues, with no students present. Demands for my resignation one year later, were not the result of organic student confusion. They were payback for violating a de facto code of faculty conduct in which one\'s right to speak is now dictated by adherence to an ascendant orthodoxy in which one\'s race, gender and sexual orientation are paramount. The students were on a mission. They were unwitting tools of a witting movement.\\n\\nThis committee should take my tale as cautionary. Is there a free speech crisis on college campuses? One can certainly make that argument, but that portrayal is at least as misleading as it is informative. What is occurring on college campuses is about power and control--speech is impeded as a last resort, used when people fail to self-censor in response to a threat of crippling stigma and the destruction of their capacity to earn.\\n\\nFull Hearing:\\nhttps://oversight.house.gov/hearing/c...","keywords":["Free Speech","College","Campus","Oversight Committee","Testimony","Bret","Weinstein","Evergreen","Safe Spaces","Protest","Equity","Riot","Congress","Senate","Committee","George Bridges","Student","Activists","Antifa","Eric","Biology","Race","Gender","Sex","political correctness","university","oppression","social justice","sjw","adam carolla","Washington","Olympia","Ben Shapiro","Adam Carolla","Michael Zimmerman"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRIKJCKWla4"},{"title":"The Path to an Excellent World","image":"yt/CLHdY5Cyf58_sm.jpg","date":"Mar 28 2018","full_title":"The Path to an Excellent World","views":48265,"likes":1668,"dislikes":45,"rating":4.8949213,"length_seconds":2185,"published":1522281600000,"description":"If humanity is to survive, we will need to change the way civilization functions, rendering our system stably abundant.

He records people without their knowledge and publishes the results using the full power of our technological toolkit. He is well versed in the details of the law as to what can and cannot be legally recorded and/or published without the consent or even awareness of his targets. He is willing to risk prison to capture his stories and he has developed a policy of not settling out of court, even when it would be financially advantageous to do so. Clearly, he is willing to risk ruin and hatred for what he is doing, and is therefore not a man to be lightly trifled with. \\n\\nIn this episode, Eric sits down with James to try to understand the mutant future of journalism as it reckons with the power of new technology, while continuing to move away from traditional newspapers and reporting. Eric tries to discover what is truly motivating O\'keefe and why he would want to come on a show that has been so openly critical of his organization. \\n\\nJames has many who see him as a crusading hero. He has also been accused of unethical deception, trespassing, entrapment, selective editing, and an entire litany of ethics complaints from traditional media. Oddly, however, more standard reporters working for traditional news desks openly discuss among themselves the professional need to deceive their targets in order to get the truth, or at least the story. Such strategies include using disingenuous flattery, pretending to be the source\'s friend, threats, the lure of fame, and a host of other edgy techniques to get people to say things that the reporter knows will likely be personally disastrous for the person being quoted. \\n\\nThis raises the question of just what it is that makes James O\'Keefe different from a more mainstream reporter. Is it his method, more than his chosen targets? Is it that he really doctors his footage or instead that he has revived older journalistic techniques to hunt new journalists? This interview may not answer all of these questions, but we hope it may prove to be a conversation unlike any you have previously heard on this topic.\\n\\n\\nOriginal Audio Sponsors:\\n\\nSkillshare: Skillshare.com/portal\\n\\nBlinkist: Blinkist.com/portal\\n\\nPitney Bowes: PB.com/Portal\\n\\nVincero: VinceroWatches.com - (code PORTAL)","keywords":["project veritas","journalism","hidden camera","investigative","scandal","mainstream","media","news","maverick","ABC","conservative","liberal","story","60 minutes","chicago sun times","pulitzer"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31CvsBlKGYg"},{"title":"25 - The Construct - Jeffrey Epstein","image":"yt/dJNjH4SP6vw_sm.jpg","date":"Apr 10, 2020","full_title":"The Portal, Ep. #025 (solo with host Eric Weinstein), The Construct - Jeffrey Epstein","views":423307,"likes":13937,"dislikes":318,"rating":4.910768,"length_seconds":3833,"published":1586476800000,"description":"Over half a year ago, immediately following the reported death of Jeffrey Epstein, Eric recorded a solo episode that he never released in hopes that its subject matter would be overtaken by investigative journalism. As this has not happened, it is being released with some trepidation in March of 2020 due to the issue of state involvement with Jeffrey Epstein.  \\n\\n\\nEric discusses his memories of his single bizarre meeting (circa 2004?) with Jeffrey Epstein in Epstein\'s 71st St townhouse in Manhattan. While at that meeting, Eric was surprised by Epstein\'s strange behaviors and came to the conclusion that it was highly unlikely that Epstein was likely to be the money manager he claimed. Instead, Eric came to the conclusion that the person with whom he was sitting was more probably a construction of one or more intelligence agencies, interested alternatively in powerful actors and scientists.\\n\\n\\nThis 15 year hypothesis and Epstein\'s mysterious death lead to Eric\'s four questions: \\n\\n\\nA) Where are the newspaper stories tracking the financial records from the Villard House offices on Madison Avenue of Jeffrey Epstein\'s hedge fund and financial management firm J. Epstein & Co.? Who holds these records? What trades do they show? Who were the prime brokers? Where are any former employees who executed trades? Was there never a hedge fund at all? If not, is the inexplicable Epstein fortune and the missing Robert Maxwell fortune actually one and the same fortune? \\n\\n\\nB) Where are the newspaper stories detailing the known border crossings where Ghislaine Maxwell\'s passports were last presented to the immigration agents of any government? Where was her last known social engagement? Is she continuing to file and pay taxes? Why is she not being sought by law enforcement and where is the government request for any information as to her last whereabouts? How did this person simply vanish in a world where Tech tracks everyone at all times? Where did her digital trail run cold? \\n\\n\\nC) Where are the newspaper stories asking whether Jeffrey Epstein was known to be connected to any US or foreign intelligence agencies? Where are the on-the-record stories asking if the US and its allies categorically deny refusing to work with any known child sex traffickers? Why has have such questions not terminated in at least a categorical denial or \'no comment\' response or even a refusal to discuss \'sources and methods\'? \\n\\n\\nD) Why is there no routine call from Journalists, Senators, Congressmen and women, Academics, Clergy or Business leaders for hearings into the intelligence communities in the wake of Epstein and related affairs, as there was during the 1970s when the Church and Pike committees uncovered dirty tricks campaigns against lawful citizens?

Perry served as the U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in the Carter administration and then as the 19th U.S. Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He oversaw the development of the strategic nuclear systems that are currently in our arsenal. His new offset strategy ushered in the age of stealth, smart weapons, GPS, and technologies that changed the face of modern warfare. \\n\\nIn 2015, he founded the William J. Perry Project, outlining his vision of a world free from nuclear weapons, and educating the public on the urgent but practical steps that could be taken to reduce nuclear dangers. \\n\\nDr. Perry has now co-authored a new book: THE BUTTON: The New Nuclear Arms Race and Presidential Power from Truman to Trump which recounts the terrifying history of nuclear launch authority, with firsthand testimonies from the front lines of our nation’s nuclear history.\\n\\nHe is the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor (emeritus) at Stanford University. At 92 years old, he continues to travel the world in pursuit of his goal of reducing the threat from nuclear weapons.\\n\\nLisa Perry is the Communications Director for The William J. Perry Project. The granddaughter of Secretary Perry, she has dedicated her career to sounding the alarm about the modern threat of nuclear weapons for the post cold war generations. Lisa is committed to empowering the public by breaking down the complex issues surrounding these weapons.\\n\\nAt the Brink is a new podcast about humanity\'s most terrifying weapon and the stories of those who have shaped its history. When former Secretary of Defense William Perry declared he believed that the danger of a nuclear catastrophe was greater today than any time in history, his granddaughter, Lisa Perry, set out to discover why. Featuring the personal stories of presidents, cabinet members, congressmen, nuclear physicists, atomic bomb survivors, military officials, and activists, At The Brink is a primer for every world citizen to learn how close we’ve come to disaster, and how we can still step back from the nuclear brink.\\n\\nWilliam Perry’s Nuclear Terrorism Scenario:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUuOskX3z7U\\n\\nWebsite: www.wjperryproject.org\\n\\nTwitter: @SecDef19 and @LisaAtTheBrink\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE to continue listening and gain access to all content on samharris.org/subscribe\\n\\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\\n\\nFollow Sam on Twitter: https://twitter.com/samharrisorg\\n\\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\\n\\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\\n\\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org\\n\\nArtwork credit: Doug Chayka","keywords":["sam harris","sam harris podcast","waking up podcast","waking up","waking up with sam harris","sam harris waking up","waking up sam harris","sam harris jordan peterson","sam harris joe rogan","author","neuroscientist","philosopher","philosophy","Making Sense Podcast","Making Sense"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVnwc4rZI_0"},{"title":"Making Sense with Sam Harris #208 - A Conversation with Toby Ord (June 23, 2020)","image":"yt/MXdCnOw3NL0_sm.jpg","date":"Jun 23, 2020","full_title":"Making Sense with Sam Harris #208 - A Conversation with Toby Ord (June 23, 2020)","views":119829,"likes":1828,"dislikes":169,"rating":4.6614923,"length_seconds":3898,"published":1592870400000,"description":"In this episode of the podcast, Sam Harris speaks with Toby Ord about preserving the long term future of humanity.  \\n\\nThey discuss:\\n-moral biases with respect to distance in space and time\\n-the psychology of effective altruism\\n-feeling good vs doing good\\n-possible blindspots in consequentialism\\n-natural vs. human-caused risk\\n-asteroid impacts\\n-nuclear war\\n-pandemics\\n-the potentially cosmic significance of human survival\\n-the difference between bad things and the absence of good things\\n-population ethics\\n-Derek Parfit\\n-the asymmetry between happiness and suffering\\n-climate change\\n-and other topics\\n\\nToby Ord is a philosopher at Oxford University, working on the big picture questions facing humanity.

Stem cell biologist, bestselling author of The Biology of Belief and recipient of the 2009 Goi Peace Award, he has been a guest speaker on hundreds of TV and radio shows, as well as keynote presenter for national and international conferences.\\n\\nIn 1982, Dr. Lipton began examining the principles of quantum physics and how they might be integrated into his understanding of the cell’s information processing systems. He produced breakthrough studies on the cell membrane, which revealed that this outer layer of the cell was an organic homologue of a computer chip, the cell’s equivalent of a brain. His research at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, between 1987 and 1992, revealed that the environment, operating though the membrane, controlled the behavior and physiology of the cell, turning genes on and off. His discoveries, which ran counter to the established scientific view that life is controlled by the genes, presaged one of today’s most important fields of study, the science of epigenetics. Two major scientific publications derived from these studies defined the molecular pathways connecting the mind and body. Many subsequent papers by other researchers have since validated his concepts and ideas.\\n\\nGet the After Skool Kid\'s Book - Why Don\'t Country Flags Use The Color Purple? https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\\n\\nAdditional artwork by Alex Grey\\nSong at the end: Mars by Stellardrone\\nAudio clips from LR.tv \\n\\nAnd please hit the notifications bell so you don\'t miss future animations!

The right brain has more creative parts like; imagination, intuition, visualizing your feelings and all that kind of thing\\n\\nBecause of this, it’s become a common idea that most people are either left-brained or right brained, just like they are left or right handed.

As a result of the nature of spacetime, a clock that is moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer\'s own frame of reference. A clock that is under the influence of a stronger gravitational field than an observer\'s will also be measured to tick slower than the observer\'s own clock.\\n\\nSuch time dilation has been repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities in a pair of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by clocks on the Space Shuttle running slightly slower than reference clocks on Earth, or clocks on GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel.\\nCorrection: Einstein published the his theory of Special Relativity in 1905, not 1919.

They make learning fun and easy.\\n\\nIf you\'re interesting in hiring us to create an animation for your company, please visit https://www.afterskool.net/services/ for details!\\n\\nMagnum opus is a latin term that is defined as someone’s greatest life achievement. It is the highest intersection of talent, skill and hard work, when someone reaches their maximum potential at the exact right time in the exact right place.\\nEveryone has a massive amount of potential, whether it be an invention, a painting, a song, a journey, a book, an idea, you name it, but very few actually get to flourish and reach for that potential. When you’re a young child, you hold the belief that anything is possible, no dream is too big...so what happens between childhood and adulthood that crushes so many dreams? Why do so many settle? Is it the school system? Is it “realistic” expectations? Financial fear? Practicality? A lack of belief?\\n\\nThe reason people don’t attempt their magnum opus is because of doubt. Doubt is the ultimate crippler of ambition. In order to believe in yourself, you must have evidence to support this belief. It’s like a table. Your belief is the table-top and the legs are experiences and evidence that support the belief. Doubt is like a woodpecker, that chips away at the legs of the table. When enough doubt creeps into your mind, the table comes crashing down and you no longer believe in yourself. The key is to reverse this process. Move toward beliefs that empower you, then find role models, experiences, stories and evidence to support the new empowering belief. Most importantly, do not listen to the doubters. Doubters are cynical people who have never attempted what you’re setting out to do. Buddha said, “we are what we think, all that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.” Achieving your goal starts with the mental belief that it can be done. Attitude is far more important than IQ.\\n\\nIt may seem scary and unfamiliar, for the path to your magnum opus is never easy. You will have to be willing to take risks, sacrifice, and to go the extra mile. At the end of this short life, you want to look back and say, i gave it my all. I took a shot, and left it all on the line.\\n\\nThis simple exercise can help you focus your energy and home in on your magnum opus journey. Write down things you love to do, things you’re good at and things people will pay you to do. The intersection of these 3 categories is your “sweet spot”. Perhaps you can combine things from all 3 categories. The key to reaching your magnum opus is to find your sweet spot and take action.\\n\\nFor more interesting animations, please subscribe!

A backlash against the hippy counterculture – “the war on drugs” – halted research into psychedelics. In 1971, the UK parliament introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act, classifying psilocybin, LSD and DMT as illegal class A drugs. All further research on psychedelics was banned.\\n\\nThe definition of a schedule 1 drug, which the most illegal classification, is a substance that has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Since the 1970’s there has been strong advocacy to take cannabis off the schedule 1 list. Cannabis has been found to improve many health issues, such as seizures, sleep disorders and arthritis. Although cannabis still remains on the schedule 1 list today, The evidence is so strong in favor of medicinal marijuana that it has become legalized in over half the U.S states and many countries around the world.\\n\\nThe legalization of cannabis has opened the door to re-examine the possible medical benefits of other currently illegal substances, like psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and DMT. The first new studies in over 30 years are finding that these so called dangerous drugs can have a profound positive impact on mental health when used properly.\\nDepression is a growing problem and antidepressants continue not to work for up to half of the people who take them. A recent study examined the treatment of 20 patients suffering from depression. Half took antidepressants and half took psilocybin. After three months, the antidepressant effects were found to be greater for those taking psilocybin than for people taking typical antidepressants and therapy. Patients said they went from feeling “totally disconnected” with themselves and the world to “connected”, and from repressing and avoiding emotions and memories to accepting them.\\nUnlike antidepressants, which are taken daily, psilocybin therapy would take place a few times over a series of months until the patient decides that they no longer need it.\\n\\nIn most cases, only a few sessions of psilocybin are needed to bring about permanent change. Other research has found a similar positive impact on depression with the use of LSD, DMT and Ketamine. The push for more research on psychedelics is growing fast, but we still need a much deeper understanding before this becomes mainstream.","keywords":["Psychedelics cure depression","psilocybin used for depression","antidepressants","SSRI","MDMA","legalize","cannabis","magic mushrooms","Albert Hoffman","Age of Psychedelics","Psychedelic research","psilocybin study","schedule 1 drug","DMT","Ketamine","ayahuasca","medical marajuana","Hallucinogen","anxiety","mental health","therapy","after skool","compass news","johns hopkins"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNzRTEjoyA"},{"title":"Playing God - The Story of Synthetic Life","image":"yt/QC6HFEIgvDM_sm.jpg","date":"Aug 20 2018","full_title":"PLAYING GOD - The Story of Synthetic Life","views":81927,"likes":2583,"dislikes":185,"rating":4.7326589,"length_seconds":314,"published":1534809600000,"description":"Head over the Professor Dave\'s Channel for some really awesome educational videos! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cd...\\n\\nIn 2016, the first synthetic organism of original design was created. When you hear this statement, what does it make you think of? The word synthetic does imply that something was built by man. But if you’re imagining artificial intelligence, or robots, or anything mechanical, you’re way off the mark. Synthetic life refers to actual, biological, living organisms. How can such a thing be synthesized? To put this achievement into context, let’s examine the history of chemical synthesis. Up until the early 19th century, it was a widespread belief that living organisms, along with all the stuff inside them, had some kind of special essence, or life-energy. These substances could only come from other life, and not from non-life. This notion was called vitalism. But in 1828, Friedrich Wohler proved that this is not the case by synthesizing urea, a compound found in the human body. On that day, organic chemistry was born. In the decades that followed, chemists learned how to synthesize all kinds of compounds, and by the latter half of the 20th century, this field had become incredibly sophisticated, thanks to an expansive understanding of the molecular world. In 1972, a team led by Robert Burns Woodward completed a landmark synthesis of Vitamin B-12, and other efforts have yielded the possibility of mass producing compounds for use in medicine, or as materials for the development of new technologies.\\n\\nBut in a way, an echo of vitalism persists to this day. There are those who think that if humans synthesize a natural product, like a vitamin, that it must be inferior to one that nature makes. This is not so. Nature builds these molecules just like we do, and it has its own biosynthetic pathways to make them. But nature’s laboratory is inside living organisms. These are delicate systems, so chemistry must be done at a very specific temperature and pH, and only with the materials at hand. In our own laboratories, we have no such limitations. We can put whatever we want in a flask and heat it up, cool it down, use strong acids and bases, exotic compounds that don’t exist in nature, and most importantly, sentience. We can decide what chemistry to do, rather than relying on the chemistry that nature has stumbled upon by blind chance over the millenia. For this reason, we can do chemistry that nature simply can’t, and we can often arrive at the same products with much greater efficiency. Whatever the molecule might be, if nature makes it, or we make it, there’s no difference. If two molecules have the same atoms connected in the same way, they’re the same, no matter how they got there. If this were not true, the field of organic chemistry could not exist, and the field is thriving, to say the least.\\n\\nFrom simple molecules, we soon learned how to synthesize large biomolecules, like proteins and DNA. We developed techniques like solid phase peptide synthesis, which makes it absolutely trivial to synthesize any protein we want. The advent of CRISPR and gene-editing technology has made it easy to edit DNA sequences. And now, Craig Venter and his team have taken the next step. Syn 3.0 is an entire synthetic genome, consisting of only 473 genes, the fewest of any living organism. This genome, when expressed, takes the form of a single-celled organism, one that has never existed in nature. It was invented, created, built, manifested, whatever verb you want to use, by mankind. If going by a certain definition of a god, we are now one, as we have created life.\\n\\nSynthetic life is the final nail in the coffin for vitalism. What chemists have known for almost two hundred years is now clear as day for all to see. The ingredients of life can be built by humans. Beyond synthesizing basic organic compounds, we can now create an entire self-replicating living organism from scratch. What is the next step? Synthetic microorganisms that rapidly consume carbon dioxide to counteract climate change? Others that produce clean fuels? Could we even make synthetic plants and animals, creating entirely new species dreamt up purely by imagination? What should we create, and what shouldn’t we create? Time will tell, but the possibilities are truly endless.\\n\\nPlease Support After Skool on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\\nTo Check out the After Skool Graphic Novel visit our website https://www.afterskool.net/\\nFor more weekly animations, please subscribe!","keywords":["synthetic life","organic chemistry","history of chemical synthesis","syn 3.0","craig venter","artificial intelligence","playing god","synthesize molecules","protein","dna","vitalism","god created all life","professor dave explains","afterskool","chemistry","vitamin b 12","urea","Friedrich Wohler","Robert Burns Woodward","self replicating"],"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC6HFEIgvDM"},{"title":"Privacy is No Longer a Social Norm","image":"yt/rsKw5BkWesw_sm.jpg","date":"Aug 13 2018","full_title":"Privacy is NO LONGER a Social Norm","views":192443,"likes":8604,"dislikes":369,"rating":4.8355064,"length_seconds":393,"published":1534204800000,"description":"If you want to protect your privacy online then a VPN is critical.

Every second you are online, your behavior is being tracked and stored into a file that can be sold to companies trying to sell products to you. Even when you’re not online, your phone is listening. In this age of technology, privacy seems to be something of the past. There is an illusion that the internet is free, but the fact is your personal information is worth a lot, and you end up paying dearly for it in the end.\\n\\nTo most people, the lack of privacy doesn’t seem like a big deal. Constant surveillance goes hand in hand with the internet. Only 3% of people who use google have actually read the terms and conditions that they agreed to. There is a sentiment today that only “bad people” want privacy. Only those with things to hide care about privacy. But the fact of the matter is we all do things when we think we’re alone that we would never do out in public. There are things we say to those we trust in confidence that would mortify us if they were got out.\\n\\nWhen we’re in a state where we are being monitored our behavior changes. There are plenty of social science experiments to back this up. One the most famous experiments was developed by an English Philosopher named Jeremy Bentham in 1791. At the time, prisons in England were overcrowded and there weren’t enough guards to keep order. So Bentham designed a new type of prison structure, called the panopticon, which allowed all inmates to be observed at all times by a single guard. In the panopticon prison, every inmate was separated into a cell that faced inward towards one guard tower. The guard in the tower sat in the dark and stared out through a tiny window which was covered with shutters; so the guard could see out and no one could see in. Since the inmates could not see the guard in the tower, it created the illusion that they were being watched at all times. This design had such a profound impact on the inmates behavior, that all riots and resistance ceased. Just knowing that they were visible was enough to keep the inmates in line. In fact, In order for this to work, they didn’t even need a guard in the tower. All that was needed was the fear of potentially being watched at all times.\\n\\nconstant surveillance creates a prison in the mind. The panopticon proved to be the ultimate enforcer of obedience and compliance and this same principle has been carried over to schools, hospitals, airports, the workplace and now practically every public corner of society.\\n\\nTo those in authoritative power, Anyone who poses a meaningful challenge to authority must be stopped. So Essentially, If you completely render yourself harmless and conforming in every way possible as someone who poses no threat whatsoever, then you have nothing to worry about. .\\n\\nHere’s a powerful quote from 19th century philosopher, Rosa Luxemburg “Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.”\\n\\nMaybe not today, but someday you will want to explore an idea that doesn’t conform to the ever narrowing standards of society and when that time comes wouldn’t you like the freedom to act without being judged or surveillanced. Privacy is a basic human right.\\n\\nFor more interesting videos please subscribe.

Our materialist science reduces everything to matter, materialist science in the West says that we are just meat, we’re just our bodies. So when the brain is dead, that’s the end of consciousness, there is no life after death, there is no soul; we just rot and are gone. Actually, many honest scientists should admit that consciousness is the greatest mystery of science and that we don’t know exactly how it works. The brain is involved in it some way but we’re not sure how. It could be that the brain generates consciousness the way a generator makes electricity, if you hold to that paradigm, then of course you can’t believe in life after death, when the generator’s broken, consciousness is gone. But it’s equally possible that the relationship — and nothing in neuroscience rules it out – that the relationship is more like the relationship of the TV signal to the TV set, and in that case, when the TV set is broken, of course the TV signal continues. And this is the paradigm of all spiritual traditions, that we are immortal souls temporarily incarnated in these physical forms.\\n\\nIf we want to understand consciousness, the last people we should ask are materialist scientists. Instead, we should look at ancient cultures, like the Egyptians, who highly valued dream states. Many ancient cultures around the world used hallucinogenic plants to understand consciousness and expand their minds.\\n\\nHowever in today\'s society, visionary plants are highly illegal because they promote a state of consciousness that does not agree with the agenda of profit. Substances, like coffee, alcohol, sugar and pharmaceuticals, are forced upon the population, but possession of even small quantities of cannabis, Ayahuasca or psilocybin will land you in jail. If we do not recognize the right of adult sovereignty over consciousness, then we can NOT claim to be free.\\n\\nLook at what our moderns state of consciousness has done. We have destroyed the natural gifts of earth in pursuit of short-term, selfish gain. We must reconnect with spirit immediately or else we will encounter disaster. Visionary plants could be the remedy for our current sickness.\\n\\nDisclaimer: We are not promoting risky, illegal or dangerous behavior. Do your research before taking any action.

To stop it ever happening again they set out to find ways to control this hidden enemy within the human mind.\\n\\nSigmund Freud\'s daughter, Anna, and his nephew, Edward Bernays, provided the centrepiece philosophy. The US government, big business, and the CIA used their ideas to develop techniques to manage and control the minds of the American people. But this was not a cynical exercise in manipulation.

It should be encouraged to express itself.\\n\\nOut of this came a political movement that sought to create new beings free of the psychological conformity that had been implanted in people\'s minds by business and politics.\\n\\nThis programme shows how this rapidly developed in America through self-help movements like Werber Erhard\'s Erhard Seminar Training - into the irresistible rise of the expressive self: the Me Generation.\\n\\nBut the American corporations soon realised that this new self was not a threat but their greatest opportunity.

Trade between Africa and Asia is booming despite strict laws and prohibitions.\\n\\nAt the same time, the population of Africa is exploding. Four billion people are expected to live south of the Sahara by the end of the century. Conflicts of interest with nature are inevitable. Providing sustainable protection for elephants will therefore require more than just banning the trade in ivory. Rescue for Africa’s elephants could come from the vastness of Siberia. In the thawing permafrost of the Arctic lie unexpected treasures: the tusks of millions of mammoths. They can be traded legally and are of the same quality as ivory from elephants.\\n\\nThe film tells the story of elephant and mammoth ivory, looks at the legal and illegal trade, asks whether ivory from the extinct ice age giants could save their endangered cousins in Africa from being wiped out.

This documentary takes viewers to Poland’s Baltic coast, to Norway, the USA and the Pacific Ocean. It accompanies scientists who are investigating how heavily the seabed has in some places already been contaminated by leaking oil, observing the rotting wrecks, developing danger scenarios and issuing warnings: the oil from several sunken ships urgently needs to be pumped out. There is still time to safely dispose of the sea’s \\"black tears.\\" But, despite all the warnings, so far very few governments are prepared to take action. Although pumping out the wrecks is technically possible, it would be a complex and expensive process. But we are at the start of a critical phase. After decades of corrosion in salty seawater, sometimes the slightest vibration is enough to cause the steel hulls of the sunken warships to split open. Marine researchers, coastguards and salvage experts worldwide agree the question is not if, but when, further massive oil spills from World War II wrecks will cause an environmental disaster.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But some substances, like neonicotinoids, kill not only pests but bees as well. Now the Bayer Group, one of the main manufacturers of these pesticides, is coming under pressure.\\n\\nScientists around the world have found that neonicotinoids are the main cause of mass bee deaths. Research has shown that a number of insecticides should have been banned long ago. For years, the Bayer Group has sought to silence the critics and pressure scientists into not publishing their findings.\\n\\nFor more than two decades, experts have been warning of the negative effects of neonicotinoids, with a whole range of studies published on the subject. It would appear that the industry, aided by the authorities, managed to successfully delay any ban on these substances for years. Studies show that neonicotinoids not only kill pests, but also bees and other beneficial insects. Dutch toxicologist Henk Tennekes was among the first to recognize the problem. He believes neonicotinoids are the most toxic insecticides ever produced. He discovered a study carried out by Bayer itself, back in 1991, which found that a particular neonicotinoid had a negative effect on the nervous system of a fly species. These effects were said to be \\"irreversible”. Tennekes then confronted the company with his findings. He was taken aback by the response: \\"Bayer now claims” he says, \\"that the binding of critical receptors in the nervous system by neonicotinoids is reversible. So they’re contradicting the results of their own study.  ... If they had considered what impact this substance has, they would have had to take it off the market.\\" \\n\\nScientists in France also analyzed mass bee deaths and likewise identified an insecticide made by Bayer as the culprit. Toxicologist Jean-Marc Bonmatin reveals how the company then sought to prevent the results from being published. Meanwhile, toxicologists in Japan discovered that neonicotinoids also harm other creatures, such as fish and river crabs. There too, Bayer sought to suppress publication.  \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But does 3D printing make everything better? This film shows how innovation can change the world of goods.\\n\\nIs the way we make things about to become the next revolution? Traditional manufacturing techniques like milling, casting and gluing could soon be replaced by 3D printing -saving enormous amounts of material and energy. Aircraft maker Airbus is already benefiting from the new manufacturing method. Beginning this year, the A350 airliner will fly with printed door locking shafts. Where previously ten parts had to be installed, today that’s down to just one. It saves a lot of manufacturing steps. And 3D printing can imitate nature\'s efficient construction processes, something barely possible in conventional manufacturing. Another benefit of the new technology is that components can become significantly lighter and more robust, and material can be saved during production. But the Airbus development team is not yet satisfied. The printed cabin partition in the A350 has become 45 percent lighter thanks to the new structure, but it is complex and expensive to manufacture. It takes 900 hours to print just one partition, a problem that print manufacturers have not yet been able to solve. The technology is already being used in Adidas shoes: The sportswear company says it is currently the world’s largest manufacturer of 3D-printed components. The next step is sustainable materials, such as biological synthetic resins that do not use petroleum and can be liquefied again without loss of quality and are therefore completely recyclable. This documentary sheds light on the diverse uses of 3D printing.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It can cause outrage - but hunting can offer a way to preserve nature and protect threatened species. Such as the one-hundred elephants that will be resettled in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nAngry online commentators agree: trophy hunting is reprehensible, immoral and absolutely unnecessary. But is it really that simple? There are hunting projects that guarantee the survival of endangered species - provided they are managed well.\\n\\nSango, a private game reserve in southeastern Zimbabwe, is owned by German businessman Wilfried Pabst. Sixty percent of Sango’s operating costs is financed through what it calls sustainable use - in other words, trophy hunting. Pabst has faced enormous hostility, but is that fair? The concept behind Sango is to allow some animals to be hunted to generate capital to support the rest. Pabst has been so successful with this model that he now has too many animals of various species for Sango or Zimbabwe to support.\\n\\nThe elephants in particular are a huge problem. The giant pachyderms spend around 20 hours a day eating, and destroy their own habitat. Pabst has to reduce their number to protect the habitat. He gets permission to cull 100 elephants - but he loves his animals and looks for alternatives. He finds a surprising way out.\\n\\nHundreds of kilometers further north is picturesque Rifa on the Zambezi River. Another German businessman, Ralph Koczwara, leases the land and comes up with a spectacular idea. The elephants should be relocated. A unique rescue maneuver begins.

How can disadvantaged people guard against false promises? Who can they turn to for help?\\n\\nWe meet three founders of social ventures. They want to overcome the barriers in society and are committed to improving equal opportunities and creating more social justice. Poverty means not only a low income, but above all a lack of opportunities to shape one\'s own life and advance in society. Many do not succeed in this on their own, but need support.\\n\\nReport by Claudia Laszczak\\nFounders Valley (3/3)\\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/LK1GoGFCfZ8\\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/b0wZIB_oYWo\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In particular, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are opening completely new horizons. In their film about AI, Tilman Wolff and Ranga Yogeshwar examine the role AI plays in the spread of fake news. They also consider a future with robots and the risks and ethical questions posed by the development of autonomous weapons. To address these issues, they travel the globe to speak with leading experts. AI can generate perfectly forged sound and videos, making it effective for purveying fake news. Discerning the truth from fiction will become increasingly difficult. Technology will streamline work, making some jobs surplus to requirements. Software will pilot self-driving cars and aerial drones. AI is rapidly opening up new vistas, but turning blind corners at speed can be risky.

But what decisions can technology make on our behalf? How far can it go? AI is still in its infancy.\\n\\nCharlie is supposed to explore the Moon for us sometime.  But no human lives will be at risk during his mission, because Charlie\'s a machine. The simian-like robot is currently still earthbound: he can currently be seen trying somewhat helplessly to navigate a papier mâché mock-up of the lunar surface at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Kaiserlsautern. Professor Wolfgang Wahlster, co-founder of the institution and, until recently, its boss, believes Charlie can be of great not only in space, but also here on Earth. He says intelligent robots could carry out dangerous jobs, search for victims buried in earthquakes or seal off a radioactive nuclear power plant after a meltdown. But what are AI’s limits? Can an autonomous car decide for itself whether it run over a child in the road or swerve into groups of people on the sidewalk instead? Our professional lives will also change. AI will make many jobs obsolete too - although it will also create new ones. The renowned Professor Wolfgang Wahlster believes that it will be down to politicians and society to define ethical boundaries. Meanwhile, he himself has become more humble. Forty years of research in the field of AI has given him a huge respect for human intelligence, which he says we are still light years away from being able to reproduce.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Their aim is to build a habitable research station on the Moon. What is the current state of play in international lunar research?\\n\\nFor four and a half billion years, the Moon has been the Earth’s constant companion. Fifty years after man first set foot on its surface, researchers around the world are again working flat out on a new lunar mission to the Moon with the aim of setting up a habitable research station there. In 1969, the American astronaut Neil Armstrong spent less than a day on the Moon. Now the aim is to actually be able to live there. However, there are still some significant obstacles to overcome. Unprotected by any atmosphere, the Moon’s surface is exposed to a hundred times more radiation than the Earth, and any habitable Moon base will have to solve this problem. But how will they be able to build a module where researchers can live and work for months at all? Engineers and scientists are working on ways to use Moon dust, which is similar to basalt, as a building material. Another problem is that space suits have mainly been designed for space travel and they are unsuitable for use in low gravity conditions - the Moon’s gravity is just a sixth of the Earth’s. The German Aerospace Center’s EDEN ISS project is testing ways to cultivate food in a hostile environment in Antarctica, growing tomatoes and cucumbers are grown in a closed-circuit container. The filmmakers visit research institutes all over the world to get up-to-date answers to the most crucial questions about lunar research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Paul Austin, who’s something of an LSD guru in Silicon Valley says, \\"People who responsibly take psychedelic drugs in microdoses will rule the job markets of the future.” But others are sceptical. They warn about self-medication, saying there’s no way of knowing the LSD’s concentration. If things go wrong, psychoses and persistent sensory disorders may follow. But this documentary shows there is more to it. After years of being locked away with the poisons, \'acid\' is back and a hit among a new generation of researchers and doctors. Some say it can ease depression and anxiety. So is LSD good medicine? This film explores the past and present of a drug that was legal until the 1960s and was used by doctors to treat the blues and alcohol addiction.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The bloggers filmed the majority of the video footage themselves, chronicling the unrest in the semi-autonomous territory in an unusual and arrestingly direct fashion. \\n\\nIn February 2019 the Hong Kong government announced draft legislation that would have allowed the extradition of its residents to mainland China. Critics feared it would open the backdoor to Beijing. Hong Kong may be part of China, but it enjoys special rights like freedom of speech and assembly under the one country, two systems policy. These proposed changes to the extradition laws sparked an ongoing wave of protests, which have repeatedly turned violent. \\n\\nAfter demonstrators stormed the Hong Kong’s legislature and the escalation of protests at Hong Kong airport, chief executive Carrie Lam announced in early September that she was scrapping the controversial extradition bill. But, by then, the protests had already become about far more than that. The demonstrators had started calling for free elections and an independent Hong Kong. On October 4, Lam invoked emergency powers in a bid to impose a ban on wearing masks, sparking further unrest. An end of the conflict is still not in sight. \\n\\nThe video diary ‘My Hong Kong’ contains five very personal accounts of the turbulent events in Hong Kong over the last few months.

They sting, bite, transmit diseases and frighten children. But, on the other hand, they are also fascinating: 480 million years ago, insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and they took over the Earth. Even now, they are fundamental to life on Earth, and are at the beginning of the food chain on which all human beings are ultimately dependent.\\nBut insect numbers worldwide are dropping, creating a rupture of  the food chain. Environmentalists and scientists are now extremely worried. Landscape ecology professor Alexandra-Maria Klein from Freiburg, for example, has been researching the effects of human interventions in natural environments for decades and has launched an experiment in a fruit plantation on Lake Constance: What happens when insects disappear? An ominous silence is settling on places that were once humming and buzzing. Why are the insects dying?

How will AI change our society in the future?\\n\\nThis documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported \'social credit system\' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to?

More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the ‘white gold’ rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use \\"natural commodities conscientiously.” But many car drivers don’t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don’t recycle used tires more effectively. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A California court has just awarded more than $2 billion in damages to a couple who had claimed that their use of the pesticide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma . Bayer’s share price halved last year, and the consequences are already making themselves felt in the company itself: Around 12,000 jobs worldwide are to be cut in the next few years, a considerable proportion of them in Germany.

The global deforestation is leading to growing problems. Nigeria and the DRC Congo - two of Europe’s main charcoal suppliers - are also affected.\\n\\nEvery year, Europeans use approximately 800,000 tons of charcoal for barbecuing. Seventy percent of the charcoal comes from outside the EU, and the bags often contain remnants of tropical woods. Officially, tropical woods are subject to strict import conditions. But when it comes to wood charcoal, these do not apply. \\nWorldwide, 2.7 billion people cook and heat with wood or charcoal. The related emission of greenhouse gases is enormous. 55 percent of global wood is used as fuel per year, and much of it is cut illegally in Africa’s bush and tropical forests. Nigeria produces most of its charcoal for export. Especially during dry periods, local Nigerian farmers use coal production as a lifeline to make money and feed their families. At the same time, charcoal mills travel the countryside in family groups, charring all the trees they can cut down. The consequences are hair-raising. Nigeria lost 36 percent of its forests between 1990 and 2005. At present, twelve percent of the country is still covered with forest - but charcoal production continues to rise, eating up 350,000 hectares of fertile land here every year. According to the UN, charcoal production is one of the main causes of deforestation in Africa, which in turn is closely linked to massive deterioration in soil quality and a growing risk of crop failure. But African legislation has been slow to respond to the problem. The coal business is highly lucrative business, and rakes in some 7.4 billion US Dollars a year. According to recent estimates, the current illegal trade in charcoal is worth almost three times as much as the trade in illegal drugs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

And now, the dangers caused by tons of melting ice are rising sharply. Every year, climate change is destroying two of the currently 70 square kilometers of glaciers left in the Alps.\\n\\nThe permafrost in the Alps is thawing, and transforming what used to be sturdy slopes into loose screes. In addition, climate change is leading to significantly more extreme weather conditions every year, while heavy rainfall causes serious erosion. The result: avalanches and landslides like those in Bondo, Switzerland, or Valsertal in Austria.\\nIn Switzerland, residential areas are shrinking as people are forced to leave their homes forever. The disappearance of glaciers as water reservoirs is already posing a major problem. Farmers in Engadine, who have been using meltwater for irrigation for centuries, are already facing water shortages. Last summer, they had to rely on helicopters to transport water to their herds in the Grison Alps. Above all, alpine villages depend on winter tourism to survive. Yet experts are forecasting that by mid-century, there will only be enough natural snow left to ski above 2,000 meters, which will spell out the end for about 70 percent of the ski resorts in the Eastern Alps. But instead of developing alternatives, lots of money is still being invested in ski tourism. Snow cannon are used to defy climate change, and artificial snow systems are under construction at ever higher altitudes. As usual, it’s the environment that is set to lose as the unique alpine landscape is further destroyed by soil compaction and erosion. Some municipalities are now working on new models of alpine tourism for the future. As global temperatures continue to rise, the cooler mountain regions will become increasingly attractive for tourists, especially in the summer.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But does the FSC really prevent illegal deforestation?\\n\\nPrimeval forests are shrinking at an increasing rate. Is exploitation of the well-intentioned FSC system failing to prevent illegal deforestation and thus deceiving consumers? The jungles of Cambodia have been all but destroyed since 2000, and now just 25 square kilometers remain. Deforestation is responsible for more CO2 emissions than all the world’s cars and trucks put together. The Bonn-based Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is responsible for the certification of sustainable forestry worldwide and its certification is considered to be the most important eco-label. It is supposed to help consumers to identify furniture, paper, planks and other goods made from \\"environmentally friendly” timber. The FSC has certified the management of more than 200 million hectares of forest to date - an area about the size of Western Europe. But what has the FSC achieved in 25 years? Manfred Ladwig and Thomas Reutter spent months filming deforestation around the world and discovered that companies accused of processing illegal timber do not necessarily lose their FSC certification and even a company condemned for illegal logging in the Brazilian rainforest can continue to use it. The film investigates the connections between the FSC, illegal deforestation and the displacement of indigenous peoples and throws an unsparing light on the global timber industry.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The victims are entitled to justice.\\" In September 2018, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, head of the German Bishops’ Conference, uttered these words and apologized to all victims of sexual abuse by Catholic officials in Germany. But Matthias Katsch, one of the most prominent representatives of victims in Germany, maintains that the Church’s handling of abuse remains problematic even now. A former pupil at the private Canisius-Kolleg school and spokesperson for the \\"Squared Table” victims’ initiative uncovered the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church in Germany in 2010. For over thirty years, his abusers’ crimes had stayed covered up. Then, Matthias Katsch and his former classmates broke the silence when they turned to the public with accusations against their former teachers - Jesuit priests Peter R. and Wolfgang S. And what happened next? Not much, it seems. Both men were spotted in Chile after 2010. Impatient with the lack of progress, Matthias Katsch took matters into his own hands and set out to Chile to find the abusers - and their next victims. Filmmaker Eva Müller went with him.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In Germany, such incidents have tripled over the last 10 years, whilst in the USA it’s five times as many. \\n\\nJürgen Thoma, who needed a new hip in 2005, says \\"We were the guinea pigs\\". He was recommended a new product, an \\"innovation\\" better than anything on the market so far. But this \\"innovation\\" has probably caused massive suffering to hundreds of people. The metal in the prostheses deteriorated due to abrasion and many patients suffered from metal poisoning that ate into their bones. Thomas Woska suffered years of pain until a defective prosthetic disc was removed from his back in a lengthy operation. The prosthesis had disintegrated, distributing fragments of plastic along the channel of his spinal cord. Internal documents from companies and ministries and countless conversations with industry representatives and whistleblowers show that side effects are repeatedly concealed. The authorities usually leave it to the manufacturers to recall defective products or issue safety warnings. Since 2010, this has happened around 1000 times a year, an average of about three times a day, but the authorities seem to have ordered only six recalls during the same period. Often nothing at all is done about defective products. Doctors regularly implant products that have hardly been tested. Internal documents from 2016 show that even the Ministry of Health assumes that only one in ten medical devices with the highest risk levels has been clinically tested, and the public is largely unaware of the risks. By linking compensation payments to obligations of confidentiality, companies prevent patients from talking about their cases. More than 250 journalists from almost 60 different media companies were involved in the worldwide research into medical products under the title \\"The Implant Files,\\" including the BBC, Le Monde and representatives from Japan, Pakistan, Mexico, Tunisia and many European countries.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Who decides how Germany should look? These questions are the subject of the film \\"Land of Inequality - Power.”\\n\\nMany studies show that a small but wealthy part of society defines a country’s political direction. It’s the same all over the world. German researchers evaluated hundreds of opinion polls on the topics of the economy, environment, foreign policy and finance. They then examined what poor people wanted from politics on these issues - and what the rich did. The differences were clear: \\"An obvious example is taxes on property,” says Armin Schäfer, a political scientist at the University of Munster. \\"Higher income groups are more skeptical about any reintroduction of a property tax, whereas lower income groups definitely want it. So far, we have not reintroduced a property tax in that form.” So who gets to decide what Germany looks like? To find out, our film follows building contractor Christoph Gröner, who has made millions from the construction business. Gröner wants to build an entire new district in Cologne, which is facing a severe housing shortfall and where rents are soaring and the poor in particular feel ignored. But he has faced delays in getting building permits. Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker says: \\"It is a city’s job to provide land and grant building permits.” But can’t it do that faster? Gröner says the politicians should take their foot off the brakes. To show how much power money really wields, we go to the places where politics and economics come together - to the district town halls and the VIP box at a Bundesliga stadium. And to Europe\'s largest real estate show in Cannes, where billionaire investors use their financial clout to shape cities and regions as they wish.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The race to dominate the market for the car of the future has entered a critical phase.\\n\\nTesla has set new standards in the automotive industry. For years, its CEO was as celebrated as any rock star. But both the boss and his company are coming under increased fire from critics. Employees have claimed working conditions at production facilities are chaotic and often questionable. Production on the Tesla assembly lines has often been brought to a standstill. Meanwhile, losses are growing, while Musk’s reputation has also become somewhat dented and scratched. Meanwhile, other major car brands are working at top speed to bump Tesla from its pole position, with Porsche leading the pack. Little is known about the German carmaker’s new electric Taycan model, but this documentary reveals just how dangerous a new electric Porsche could be for Tesla. And major carmakers have another trump card to play. They have decades of experience in the mass production of cars, while Tesla is still a newcomer to the field. The film also shows how much German technology is hidden in Tesla models, and how both Musk and new Chinese competition are betting on German expertise.

The son of two teachers, he has worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?\\n\\nChristoph Gröner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children\'s home. Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. \\"What we see here is total failure across the board,” he says. \\"It starts with parents who just don’t get it and can’t do anything right. And then there’s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today.\\" Chistoph Gröner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality?\\nIn Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany’s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. \\"Land of Inequality\\" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children’s outlooks.\\n_______\\nWatch Part I\\nInequality - how wealth becomes power\\nhttps://youtu.be/AFIxi7BiScI\\nPart 3 Inequality - how wealth becomes power\\nhttps://youtu.be/wEufTD39xrw\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind.\\n\\nFor the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gröner, one of Germany’s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. \\"If you have great wealth, you can’t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,” Gröner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  \\"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we’re more independent,” Gröner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanović, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. \\"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,\\" Milanović notes. \\"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?”\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The rich consume much more than the poor and produce much more waste. Trash has become a symbol of our times.\\n\\nBut what some people throw away, means money to others and a chance to survive. The amount of waste we generate and the way we deal with it speak volumes about our consumption and prosperity - and also about our levels of social inequality. In the documentary, \\"The Rich, the Poor and the Trash,\\" co-directors Naomi Phillips and Thomas Hasel explore the lives of people both working with and living off trash. Twenty-eight-year-old Godwin Ochieng lives in Dandora, a slum in Kenya, where one of the largest dumpsites in Africa is located. He spends his days combing through endless piles of garbage coming in the truckload from the city’s wealthier districts in the hope of finding something to sell: for him, the mountain of trash is a lifeline. One person who tries to help youths in the slum is Godwin Ochieng\'s role model, hip-hop star Juliani, who also comes from Dandora. The founder of the youth club wants to radically change Kenyan society. Meanwhile, halfway around the globe in one of the world’s richest and most expensive cities, Pierre Simmons searches the streets of New York for cans he can sell to recycling companies. In 2014, Pierre Simmons gave a speech about poverty to the United Nations on behalf of “Sure we can”, a non-profit recycling center in New York. “I don\'t think anybody here at Sure We Can wants to live like Wall Street people,” says Pierre. Both men live in countries where the gap between rich and poor is vast. But the social gap between the US and Kenya is also huge. Economists Lucas Chancel and Kate Raworth warn against the consequences of a huge imbalance at both the national and international levels. They believe it poses a great danger to our entire system of values in the West, to our understanding of democracy and, ultimately, to our economy.\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?\\n\\nIs organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk \\"organic\\" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.\\n_______\\n\\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What danger lies in wait for average citizens?\\n\\nFor years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.\\n\\nThe fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: \\"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more.\\" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film \'The Money Deluge\' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.\\n_______\\n\\nExciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Our film examines the debate about blasphemy in art and asks representatives of all faiths how they see it. It also looks back at the origins of religion and the history of blasphemy. We present works by artists, filmmakers and caricaturists that have been described as blasphemous, sometimes with extremely serious consequences.

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America\'s 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men\'s Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn\'t lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
