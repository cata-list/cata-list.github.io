This large number of extinctions spans numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates."},{"title":"Environment In Multiple Crises - Report","source":"BBC News","author":"Roger Harrabin","description":"Policymakers are not grasping the seriousness of what we\'re doing to the planet, a think-tank warns.","smmry":1,"link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47203344","date":""},{"title":"The Chart That Defines Our Warming World","source":"BBC News","author":"Jonathan Amos","description":"Communicating what\'s meant by climate change in one simple, easy to understand visualisation.","smmry":1,"link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48678196","date":""},{"title":"Final Call To Save The World From \'Climate Catastrophe\'","source":"BBC","author":"Matt McGrath","description":"Top scientists from around the world urge changes \'in all aspects of society\' to limit climate warming.","smmry":1,"link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45775309","date":""},{"title":"What Caused 11,000 Scientists To Declare A Climate Emergency?","source":"Ars Technica","author":"John Timmer","description":"This isn\'t a scientific analysis like the IPCC reports provide.","smmry":1,"link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/what-is-the-significance-of-11000-scientists-declaring-a-climate-emergency/","date":"Nov 08 2019"},{"title":"Climate Emergency: World \'May Have Crossed Tipping Points\'","source":"The Guardian","author":"Damian Carrington","description":"Warning of \'existential threat to civilisation\' as impacts lead to cascade of unstoppable events","smmry":1,"link":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points","date":"Nov 27 2019"},{"title":"Only Rebellion Will Prevent An Ecological Apocalypse","source":"The Guardian","author":"George Monbiot","description":"No one is coming to save us.

consists of the effects of pesticides on non-target species. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields. Runoff can carry pesticides into aquatic environments while wind can carry them to other fields, grazing areas, human settlements and undeveloped areas, potentially affecting other species. Other problems emerge from poor production, transport and storage practices. Over time, repeated application increases pest resistance, while its effects on other species can facilitate the pest\'s resurgence."},{"title":"Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill","source":"Wikipedia","author":"","description":"","smmry":0,"link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill","date":"","wikiextract":"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is an industrial disaster that began on 20 April 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP-operated Macondo Prospect, considered to be the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and estimated to be 8% to 31% larger in volume than the previous largest, the Ixtoc I oil spill, also in the Gulf of Mexico.

Epstein\'s lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation. Epstein\'s brother Mark hired Michael Baden to oversee the autopsy. In late October, Baden announced that autopsy evidence was more indicative of homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. Both the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice\'s inspector general are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with conspiracy and record falsification. Due to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of his death (e.g. the removal of his cellmate without a replacement, the falling asleep of two guards who were meant to check on him, and the malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell) and Epstein\'s claimed knowledge of compromising information about famous people, his death generated doubt about his apparent suicide and speculation that he was murdered."},{"title":"Sinclair Broadcast Group\'s News Script","source":"YouTube","author":"","description":"No description provided.","smmry":0,"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI","date":"Mar 30 2018"},{"title":"Learn About \'Dark Patterns\' on the Web","source":"Dark Patterns","author":"","description":"No description provided.","smmry":1,"link":"https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern","date":""},{"title":"We\'re Incentivizing Bad Science","source":"Scientific American Blog Network","author":"James Zimring","description":"Current research trends resemble the early 21st century\'s financial bubble","smmry":1,"link":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/were-incentivizing-bad-science/","date":"Oct 29 2019"},{"title":"Things We Wouldn\'t Know Without Wikileaks","source":"Imgur","author":"","description":"No description provided.","smmry":0,"link":"https://i.imgur.com/cIqnt.png","date":""},{"title":"How Will We Know the World Is Ending?","source":"Gizmodo","author":"Daniel Kolitz","description":"Visions of the end of the world tend to extremes—the planet fatally fracked, flooded, hurricaned, nuke-cratered.
